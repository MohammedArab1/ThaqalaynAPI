		"bookDescription": "\"Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara\" by Shaykh Muḥammad Āṣif Muḥsinī is a monumental work which fills a significant gap in the realm of the works of Ḥadīth. The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers. In summary, \"Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara\" is a milestone in Ḥadīth studies, providing a reliable reference point for those interested in authentic Shia narrations. Its meticulous assembly and rigorous criteria set it apart as a work of significant value and authority.",

What can definitely be said about the work though, based on the comments of individuals like al-Sayyid al-Zanjānī and al-Sayyid Muḥammad Riḍā al-Sīstānī is that the author is a Shīʿī who has access to the works of the Imāmī school and has great knowledge about the narrators of the sect.

It has long served as an invaluable resource for both Shīʿa scholars and the general Shīʿa population and is celebrated as one of the most notable Shīʿa Ḥadīth collections. The author's motivation for writing this book was rooted in the prophetic hadith: \"The one who leads people to good deeds is as their doer.\" Shaykh al-Ṣadūq emphasised that his primary goal in authoring the book was to seek the reward and satisfaction of God. The book is structured into two primary parts. The first part, \"Thawāb al-Aʿmāl,\" encompasses 788 Ḥadīths arranged under 389 titles, detailing the spiritual rewards for performing righteous actions.

This narrative text revolves around Mahdawiyya, offering an in-depth exploration of the 12th Imam's occultation. The work was written around thirteen years before al-Ṭūsī’s death, it incorporates powerful dialectical arguments and Ḥadīths vindicating the doctrine of the occultation of the son of al-Ḥasan al-ʿAskārī (as), in addition to responding to other proto-Shīʿī sects such as the Wāqifa and detailing the prophesied signs of his advent. The book is meticulously structured into eight chapters. The book refutes claims about Imam al-Mahdī’s death and advent times and sheds light on his characteristics, attributes, and conduct. Kitāb al-Ghayba's historical and theological importance is well-recognized due to its thorough examination of Imam al-Mahdi's occultation. al-Shaykh al-Ṭūsī’s access to first-hand accounts and his profound understanding of Ḥadīths significantly enhance the book's credibility. Its comprehensive treatment of Mahdism and occultation makes it a reference point for anyone seeking to write on these subjects.
