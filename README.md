The purpose of this project is to create an API that allows programmers to retrieve JSON of hadith found on the Thaqalayn.net website.

The endpoints provided are as follows:

... (to come)

This project also provides a web scraper 

Finally, I also included all the scraped JSONs, in case anyone would like to use them directly. Keep in mind the chapter names are not the same as appears on the Thaqalayn website. This data includes each book separately, all books combined, and a list of all books present with the maximum query id.


This project fetches all the hadith found on Thaqalayn.net as of 2022-10-01
