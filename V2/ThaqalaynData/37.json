		"englishText": "In the name of Allah (swt), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe honourable Shaykh Al Jaleel, and jurist, Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn Musa ibn Babawayh al-Qummi, the author of this book-may Allah (swt) sanctify his soul-wrote:\nAfter praise to Allah (swt), it happened that fate drove me to the lands of exile, and destiny brought me to the land of Balkh, specifically the town of Ilaq. There arrived the noble Sharif al-Din Abu Abdullah, known as Ni'mah-Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ishaq ibn [al-Hasan ibn] al-Husayn ibn Ishaq ibn Musa ibn Ja'far ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon them all).\nWith his companionship, my happiness was prolonged, my heart was comforted by his memory, and my honor was elevated by his affection, due to his noble character combined with virtues such as modesty, piety, calmness, dignity, religiosity, chastity, godliness, and humility.\nHe mentioned to me a book authored by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, the physician, titled Man La Yahduruhu al-Tabeeb (For Him Who Has No Access to a Doctor), which he found to be effective in its purpose. He requested that I compile for him a book on jurisprudence, covering lawful and unlawful matters, and the statutes and rulings, comprehensively surpassing all I had previously written on the subject, and title it Man La Yahduruhu al-Faqih (For Him Who Has No Access to a Jurist). The intention was for it to serve as his reference, foundation, and guide-one through which he could achieve reward, along with those who read, copy, or act upon its contents.\nThis was in addition to his copying most of what I carried with me from my works, listening to them, narrating them from me, and familiarizing himself with their entirety, which amounted to two hundred and forty-five books.\nI agreed to his request (may Allah (swt) grant him continuous success) because I found him deserving of it. I compiled this book by omitting the chains of narration to avoid excessive length, while ensuring its benefits were plentiful. I did not intend to follow the approach of other compilers who include all they have narrated. Instead, I included only what I issue fatwas upon, deem to be authentic, and believe to be a proof between me and my Lord (azj) -exalted be His remembrance and elevated be His power.\nEverything in this book is derived from well-known books that are relied upon and referenced, such as the book of Hariz ibn Abdullah al-Sijistani, the book of Ubaydullah ibn Ali al-Halabi, the works of Ali ibn Mahziyar al-Ahwazi, the books of al-Husayn ibn Sa'id, the Nawadir of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, the Nawadir al-Hikmah compiled by Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ash'ari, the Kitab al-Rahmah by Sa'd ibn Abdullah, the compilation of our Sheikh Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Walid (may Allah (swt) be pleased with them), the Nawadir of Muhammad ibn Abi Umayr, the books of al-Muhasin by Ahmad ibn Abi Abdullah al-Barqi, the letters of my father (may Allah be pleased with them), and other foundational texts and compilations.\nThe paths to these works are well-known in the catalog of books I have narrated from my teachers and predecessors (may Allah (swt) be pleased with them). I have exerted my utmost effort in this task, seeking Allah's (swt) assistance, placing my trust in Him, and asking forgiveness for any shortcomings. My success is only through Allah (swt). Upon Him I rely, and to Him I turn. He is sufficient for me, and He is the best trustee.",

Whoever commits adultery with a Muslim woman, or a Jewish, Christian, or Magian woman, whether free or a slave, and does not repent before death, Allah (swt) will open for him in his grave three hundred doors from which snakes, scorpions, and the serpents of the Fire will enter, burning him until the Day of Judgment. When he is resurrected from his grave, people will be harmed by the stench of his odor, and he will be recognized by this and his evil deeds in the worldly life until he is commanded to be thrown into the Fire.\"\n\"Beware! Indeed, Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden what is unlawful and set limits.

Whoever behaves arrogantly has indeed challenged Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, in His (swt) supreme authority.\"\nHe (sw) also said: \"Whoever wrongs a woman regarding her dowry is considered by Allah (swt) as an adulterer. Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, will say to him on the Day of Judgment:\n'My servant, I married you to My maidservant on My covenant, but you did not fulfill My covenant and wronged My maidservant.' Her due will be taken from his good deeds and given to her according to what she is owed.

This is in accordance with Allah's (swt) saying:\n'And do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it - his heart is sinful, and Allah (swt) is Knowing of what you do.'\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:283)\nHe (sw) also said: \"Whoever harms his neighbour, Allah (swt) will forbid him from the fragrance of Paradise, 'and his abode will be Hell, and what a miserable destination.'\nWhoever neglects the rights of his neighbour is not from us.\nArchangel Jibril (as) continued to advise me regarding the neighbour until I thought he would make him an heir.\nHe (Jibril (as)) kept advising me about slaves until I thought a time would be set when they would automatically be freed.\nHe (Jibril (as)) kept advising me about the use of the toothstick (siwak) until I thought it would be made obligatory.\nHe (Jibril (as)) kept advising me about praying at night until I thought the best of my nation would never sleep.\"\n\"Beware! Whoever belittles a poor Muslim has belittled the right of Allah (swt), and Allah (swt) will belittle him on the Day of Judgment unless he repents.\"\nHe (sw) also said: \"Whoever honors a poor Muslim will meet Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, on the Day of Judgment while He (swt) is pleased with him.\"\n\"Whoever is faced with an indecent act or desire and refrains from it out of fear of Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, Allah (swt) will forbid the Fire upon him, grant him safety from the greatest terror, and fulfill for him what He (swt) promised in His Book in His (swt) saying:\n'But for he who has feared the standing before his Lord (azj) are two gardens.'\"\n(Surah Ar-Rahman 55:46)\n\"Beware! Whoever is presented with the choice between this world and the Hereafter and chooses the world over the Hereafter will meet Allah (swt) on the Day of Judgment without a single good deed to shield him from the Fire. But whoever chooses the Hereafter over this world and abandons worldly desires, Allah (swt) will be pleased with him and will forgive his past misdeeds.\"\n\"Whoever fills his eyes with what is forbidden, Allah (swt) will fill his eyes with fire on the Day of Judgment - unless he repents and turns back.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt), peace be upon him and his family, also said:\n\"Whoever shakes hands with a woman who is unlawful for him has indeed incurred the wrath of Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic. And whoever embraces a forbidden woman will be chained with a shackle of fire alongside a devil, and both will be cast into the Fire.\"\n\"Whoever cheats a Muslim in buying or selling is not from us and will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment with the Jews, for they are the most deceitful people towards Muslims.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) forbade anyone from withholding necessary items (ma'oon) from his neighbour and said:\n\"Whoever withholds useful items from his neighbour, Allah (swt) will withhold His (swt) goodness from him on the Day of Judgment and will leave him to his own self. And whoever is left to his own self - how miserable will be his state!\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt), peace be upon him and his family, said:\n\"Any woman who harms her husband with her tongue, Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, will not accept any obligatory or voluntary acts of worship from her until she pleases him. Even if she fasts during the day, prays during the night, frees slaves, and spends in the way of Allah (swt) by supporting horses for jihad, she will still be among the first to enter the Fire - unless she seeks his satisfaction. Likewise, the same applies to a man if he wrongs his wife.\"\n\"Beware! Whoever slaps the cheek or face of a Muslim, Allah (swt) will scatter his bones on the Day of Judgment, and he will be resurrected in chains until he is thrown into Hell - unless he repents.\"\n\"Whoever sleeps with malice in his heart towards his Muslim brother, he sleeps under the wrath of Allah (swt) and will awaken in the same state until he repents.\"\nHe (sw) also forbade backbiting and said: \"Whoever backbites a Muslim, his fast becomes void, his ablution is invalidated, and he will come on the Day of Judgment with a stench emanating from his mouth more foul than that of a decaying corpse, causing discomfort to the people at the gathering. If he dies before repenting, he dies considering lawful what Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt), peace be upon him and his family, said:\n\"Whoever suppresses his anger while being capable of acting upon it and chooses patience, Allah (swt) will grant him the reward of a martyr.\"\n\"Beware! Whoever defends his brother in his absence when he hears someone backbiting him in a gathering, Allah (swt) will turn away from him a thousand doors of harm in this world and the Hereafter.

Whoever hangs a whip before a tyrannical ruler (to intimidate others), Allah (swt) will turn that whip into a serpent of fire on the Day of Judgment, seventy cubits long, which Allah (swt) will unleash upon him in the Fire of Hell - and what a terrible destination!\"\n\"Whoever does a good deed for his brother but then reminds him of it (to boast), Allah (swt) will nullify his good deed, record his sin, and will not reward him for his effort.\"\nThen he (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'I have forbidden Paradise to the one who reminds others of his favors, the miser, and the tale-bearer (slanderer).'\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Indeed, whoever gives charity, for every dirham he donates, he will receive in return the equivalent of Mount Uhud from the blessings of Paradise. And whoever personally delivers charity to a needy person will have the same reward as the giver, without the giver's reward being diminished in the slightest.\"\n\"Whoever offers the funeral prayer (Salat Al-Janazah) for a deceased person, seventy thousand angels will pray for him, and Allah (swt) will forgive his past and future sins. If he remains until the deceased is buried and the earth is placed over him, for every step he takes, he will earn a qirat of reward, and one qirat is like Mount Uhud.\"\n\"Whoever sheds tears out of fear of Allah (swt), for every drop of his tears, Allah (swt) will build for him a palace in Paradise adorned with pearls and jewels, filled with what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined.\"\n\"Whoever walks to the mosque seeking to join the congregation, for every step he takes, seventy thousand good deeds will be recorded for him, and his rank will be raised by the same number. If he dies in this state, Allah (swt) will appoint seventy thousand angels to visit him in his grave, to give him glad tidings, comfort him in his loneliness, and seek forgiveness for him until he is resurrected.\"\n\"Whoever calls the Adhan (the call to prayer) sincerely, seeking Allah's (swt) pleasure, Allah (swt) will reward him with the reward of forty thousand martyrs and forty thousand truthful ones (siddeeqin), and through his intercession, forty thousand sinners from my nation will enter Paradise.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Whoever says: 'I bear witness that there is no God but Allah (swt),' seventy thousand angels will send blessings upon him and seek forgiveness for him. On the Day of Judgment, he will be under the shade of the Throne until Allah (swt) completes the reckoning of all creation. And whoever says: 'I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (swt),' forty thousand angels will write the reward for his statement.\"\n\"Whoever maintains the first row (in prayer) and safeguards the first Takbir (opening declaration of prayer) without harming any Muslim, Allah (swt) will grant him the reward equal to that of the callers to prayer (Mu'adhins) in this world and the hereafter.\"\n\"Whoever takes responsibility over a group of people (leadership) will be brought on the Day of Judgment with his hands chained to his neck. If he governed them according to Allah's (swt) command, Allah (swt) will release him. But if he ruled unjustly, he will be cast into the Fire of Hell, and what an evil destination it is.\"\nThe Prophet (peace be upon him and his family) also said: \"Do not belittle any act of evil, even if it seems small in your eyes, and do not think lightly of any act of goodness, even if it appears great in your eyes. For there is no major sin with repentance, and no minor sin with persistence.\"\nShuayb ibn Waqid said: \"I asked Husayn ibn Zayd about the length of this narration, and he replied: ' Imam Jafar ibn Muhammad Al-Sadiq (as) ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) narrated to me that Imam (as) compiled this narration from the book that was dictated by the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) and written in the handwriting of  Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as).'\"",

Whoever honors his Muslim brother is indeed honoring Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) also forbade a man from leading a group in prayer without their permission and said:\n\"Whoever leads a group in prayer with their permission, and they are pleased with him, and he is moderate in leading them - perfecting his prayer with proper standing, recitation, bowing, prostration, and sitting - will receive a reward equal to theirs, without their reward being diminished in the least.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Whoever goes to visit a relative, using himself and his wealth to maintain family ties, Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, will grant him the reward of one hundred martyrs. For every step he takes, he will receive forty thousand good deeds, forty thousand sins will be erased from him, and his rank will be elevated by forty thousand degrees. It will be as if he worshiped Allah (swt) for one hundred years with patience and seeking reward.\"\n\"Whoever fulfills the need of a blind person from the needs of this world and walks with him until Allah (swt) fulfills his need, Allah (swt) will grant him freedom from hypocrisy and freedom from the Fire, fulfill seventy of his worldly needs, and he will continue to be immersed in Allah's (swt) mercy until he returns.\"\n\"Whoever falls ill for a day and night and does not complain to his visitors, Allah (swt) will raise him on the Day of Judgment with His close friend, Ibrahim, the Friend of the Most Merciful (as), allowing him to cross the bridge (Sirat) like a flashing lightning bolt.\"\n\"Whoever strives to fulfill the need of a sick person - whether he completes it or not - will leave his sins as pure as the day his mother gave birth to him.\"\nA man from the Ansar said: \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O' Messenger of Allah (swt)! If the sick person is from his own household, isn't that more rewarding when he strives to fulfill their need?\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) replied: \"Yes! Indeed, whoever relieves a believer of a worldly hardship, Allah (swt) will relieve him of seventy-two hardships in the Hereafter and seventy-two hardships in this world, the least of which is Abdominal pain.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Whoever delays giving the due right to someone while being capable of fulfilling it, every day that passes upon him will be recorded as the sin of a tax collector (oppressor).\"\n\"Beware! Whoever hangs a whip before a tyrannical ruler (to intimidate others), Allah (swt) will turn that whip into a serpent of fire on the Day of Judgment, seventy cubits long, which Allah (swt) will unleash upon him in the Fire of Hell - and what a terrible destination!\"\n\"Whoever does a good deed for his brother but then reminds him of it (to boast), Allah (swt) will nullify his good deed, record his sin, and will not reward him for his effort.\"\nThen he (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'I have forbidden Paradise to the one who reminds others of his favors, the miser, and the tale-bearer (slanderer).'\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Indeed, whoever gives charity, for every dirham he donates, he will receive in return the equivalent of Mount Uhud from the blessings of Paradise. And whoever personally delivers charity to a needy person will have the same reward as the giver, without the giver's reward being diminished in the slightest.\"\n\"Whoever offers the funeral prayer (Salat Al-Janazah) for a deceased person, seventy thousand angels will pray for him, and Allah (swt) will forgive his past and future sins. If he remains until the deceased is buried and the earth is placed over him, for every step he takes, he will earn a qirat of reward, and one qirat is like Mount Uhud.\"\n\"Whoever sheds tears out of fear of Allah (swt), for every drop of his tears, Allah (swt) will build for him a palace in Paradise adorned with pearls and jewels, filled with what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined.\"\n\"Whoever walks to the mosque seeking to join the congregation, for every step he takes, seventy thousand good deeds will be recorded for him, and his rank will be raised by the same number. If he dies in this state, Allah (swt) will appoint seventy thousand angels to visit him in his grave, to give him glad tidings, comfort him in his loneliness, and seek forgiveness for him until he is resurrected.\"\n\"Whoever calls the Adhan (the call to prayer) sincerely, seeking Allah's (swt) pleasure, Allah (swt) will reward him with the reward of forty thousand martyrs and forty thousand truthful ones (siddeeqin), and through his intercession, forty thousand sinners from my nation will enter Paradise.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) said:\n\"Whoever says: 'I bear witness that there is no God but Allah (swt),' seventy thousand angels will send blessings upon him and seek forgiveness for him. On the Day of Judgment, he will be under the shade of the Throne until Allah (swt) completes the reckoning of all creation. And whoever says: 'I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (swt),' forty thousand angels will write the reward for his statement.\"\n\"Whoever maintains the first row (in prayer) and safeguards the first Takbir (opening declaration of prayer) without harming any Muslim, Allah (swt) will grant him the reward equal to that of the callers to prayer (Mu'adhins) in this world and the hereafter.\"\n\"Whoever takes responsibility over a group of people (leadership) will be brought on the Day of Judgment with his hands chained to his neck. If he governed them according to Allah's (swt) command, Allah (swt) will release him. But if he ruled unjustly, he will be cast into the Fire of Hell, and what an evil destination it is.\"\nThe Prophet (peace be upon him and his family) also said: \"Do not belittle any act of evil, even if it seems small in your eyes, and do not think lightly of any act of goodness, even if it appears great in your eyes. For there is no major sin with repentance, and no minor sin with persistence.\"\nShuayb ibn Waqid said: \"I asked Husayn ibn Zayd about the length of this narration, and he replied: ' Imam Jafar ibn Muhammad Al-Sadiq (as) ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) narrated to me that Imam (as) compiled this narration from the book that was dictated by the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) and written in the handwriting of  Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as).'\"",

May Allah (swt) purify you, for the punishment in this world is lighter than the punishment in the Hereafter, which never ends.\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) asked her: \"From what should I purify you?\"\nShe replied: \"From adultery.\"\nImam (as) then asked: \"Are you a married woman or not?\"\nShe said: \"I am married.\"\nImam (as) asked: \"Was your husband present or absent?\"\nShe replied: \"He was present.\"\nImam (as) said: \"Wait until you give birth to what is in your womb, then come to me.\"\nAs she turned away and could no longer hear him, Imam (as) said: \"O' Allah (swt), this is one testimony.\"\nNot long after, she returned and said: \"I have given birth. Purify me.\"\nImam (as) feigned ignorance and said: \"Purify you from what, O' servant of Allah (swt)?\"\nShe replied: \"I have committed adultery and have given birth, so purify me.\"\nImam (as) asked her again, \"Were you married when you did what you did or not?\"\nShe said: \"Yes, I was married.\"\nImam (as) asked: \"Was your husband absent or present?\"\nShe answered: \"He was present.\"\nImam (as) said: \"Go and nurse your child.\"\nAs she turned away and could no longer hear him, Imam (as) said: \"O' Allah (swt), these are two testimonies.\"\nAfter she had nursed her child, the woman returned to the Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as), and said: \"O' Commander of the Faithful, I have committed adultery, so purify me.\"\nImam (as) asked her: \"Were you married when you did what you did or not?\"\nShe replied: \"Yes, I was married.\"\nImam (as) asked: \"Was your husband present or absent?\"\nShe answered, \"He was present.\"\nImam (as) said: \"Go and care for your child until he becomes aware enough to eat, drink, not fall from a roof, and not stumble into a well.\"\nThe woman turned away weeping, and when she was far enough not to hear him, Imam Ali (as) said: \"O' Allah (swt), this is the third testimony.\"\nAs she was crying, Amr ibn Hurayth met her and asked: \"Why are you crying?\"\nShe replied: \"I went to the Commander of the Faithful (as) and asked him to purify me, but he told me to care for my child until he eats, drinks, does not fall from a roof, and does not stumble into a well. I am afraid that death will come to me before I am purified.\"\nAmr ibn Hurayth said to her: \"Return, for I will take responsibility for your child.\"\nShe returned to Imam Ali (as) and informed him of Amr's offer.\nImam Ali (as) asked her: \"Why would Amr take responsibility for your child?\"\nShe said: \"O' Commander of the Faithful, I have committed adultery, so purify me.\"\nImam (as) asked: \"Were you married when you committed this act?\"\nShe replied: \"Yes.\"\nImam (as) then asked: \"Was your husband present or absent?\"\nShe replied: \"He was present.\"\nAt this, the Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as), raised his head toward the sky and said: \"O' Allah (swt), I have confirmed this against her with four testimonies. And You (swt) have said to Your Prophet (peace be upon him and his family) regarding Your (swt) religion:\n'O' Muhammad (sw), whoever abandons one of My (swt) prescribed punishments has opposed Me (swt) and contended with Me (swt) in My (swt) dominion'.\n'O' Allah (swt), I do not abandon Your (swt) punishments, nor do I seek to oppose You (swt) or contend with You (swt). I do not neglect Your (swt) rulings but rather obey You (swt) and follow the Sunnah of Your (swt) Prophet.\"\nAmr ibn Hurayth then said: \"O' Commander of the Faithful, I only offered to take responsibility for her child because I thought you would like that. But if you dislike it, I will not do it.\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) responded: \"After four testimonies by Allah (swt), you will indeed take responsibility for him, and you will do so in humility.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) stood up, ascended the pulpit, and said: \"O' Qanbar, call out among the people that the prayer is gathering.\"\nThe people gathered until the mosque was full.\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said: \"O' people, your Imam will go out with this woman at noon to carry out the prescribed punishment upon her, God willing.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) descended from the pulpit.\nWhen the morning came, Imam (as) went out with the woman, and the people followed, disguised and veiled with their turbans, holding stones in their hands, hidden in their cloaks and sleeves. They proceeded until they reached the open area (Al-Zuhr).\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) ordered a pit to be dug for her, and she was buried in it up to her waist.\nImam (as) then mounted his mule, placed his foot firmly in the stirrup, put his index fingers into his ears, and called out in a loud voice:\n\"O' people! Verily, Allah (swt) the Blessed and Exalted entrusted His Prophet (peace be upon him and his family) with a trust, and His Prophet (sw) entrusted me that none should carry out the prescribed punishment except one upon whom there is no prescribed punishment from Allah (swt).

Indeed, the Commander of the Faithful (as) used to instruct his officials with this.\"\nHe said:\n\"Imam (as) gave a ruling that for every bone that contains marrow, there is a specified obligatory compensation if it is broken and healed without any defect or flaw.\nImam (as) divided the obligatory blood money (diyyah) into six parts and established for wounds, the fetus, the eyelashes, paralysis, limbs, and the thumb, assigning six categories for each.\nFetus\nHe set the blood money for a fetus at one hundred dinars.\nFor the sperm of a man until it becomes a fetus, he set five parts, and when it becomes a fetus before the soul enters it, he set it at one hundred dinars.\nHe allocated twenty dinars for the sperm drop (nutfah), which refers to a man discharging with his wife who does not desire it. Thus, the Commander of the Faithful (as) set this ruling for it.\"\nHe (as) set the compensation for the nutfah (sperm drop) at twenty dinars, which is equivalent to one-fifth (khumus), and for the clot of blood (alaqah), he set it at two-fifths of that, forty dinars. This ruling also applies if a woman is struck or harmed and subsequently miscarries.\n- For the muḍghah (chewed-like lump of flesh), he established sixty dinars if she also miscarried under similar circumstances.\n- For the bone stage (idham), he set eighty dinars if the woman miscarried.\n- For the fully formed fetus (janin), he set one hundred dinars if an enemy attacked them, causing the women to miscarry. He obligated this compensation upon the women from the responsible family (aqilah) accordingly.\nIf a child is born alive and cries (istihlal, the first cry), and they were attacked during the night, leading to the killing of the children, the compensation for each male child is one thousand dinars, and for each female child, it is calculated accordingly at five hundred dinars.\nAs for a woman who is killed while pregnant with a fully formed fetus, and the fetus does not miscarry, and it is unknown whether the fetus is male or female, and whether it died before or after the mother, then the compensation for the fetus is half of the male blood money and half of the female blood money, while the woman's full blood money remains obligatory.\nHe (as) also ruled regarding a man who discharges outside his wife during intercourse without her consent. In this case, he imposed half of one-fifth of the fetus's blood money, amounting to ten dinars.\nIf he discharges inside her without her consent, the compensation is twenty dinars.\nHe established retaliation (qisas) for injuries and the related compensation according to the extent of the blood money, which is one hundred dinars.\nHe ruled on the blood money for fetal injuries proportionally from the scale of one hundred dinars, corresponding to what applies to the injuries of a man or a woman in full.\nSensory Organs and Paralysis\nHe (as) also gave rulings concerning the body.\nHe (as) established six obligatory compensations: life (nafs), vision (baṣar), hearing (samʿ), speech (kalam), impairment of voice due to nasal sound (ghanan) or hoarseness (bahah), and paralysis of the hands and legs.\nHe aligned these rulings with the same principles as the previous laws. Additionally, he prescribed the practice of qasamah (oath-taking) for each of these matters, proportional to the amount of blood money owed.\nFor intentional murder, qasamah involves fifty men, and for accidental killing, twenty-five men, corresponding to the blood money of one thousand dinars for life.\nFor wounds requiring qasamah, six people are involved, and anything less follows this calculation.\nThe qasamah applies to life, hearing, vision, intellect, voice due to hoarseness or harshness, and the loss of hands and legs. These are the six major parts of a person.\nDiyyah - Blood Money\nThe blood money for;\n- a life is one thousand dinars,\n- for the Nose (if completely severed) one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete Total loss of voice (ghanan or bahah) one thousand dinars,\n- for paralysis of both hands one thousand dinars,\n- for the total loss of hearing one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete loss of vision one thousand dinars,\n- for loss of both legs together one thousand dinars,\n- for the Total removal of both lips one thousand dinars,\n- for a severe bent hunchback of the back thousand dinars,\n- for the Complete severance of the male genital organ one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete removal of the tongue one thousand dinars,\n- for Loss of both testicles one thousand dinars.\nInjuries; amputation, fractures, cracks, depressions, open wounds (muḍihah), bleeding wounds (damiyah), dislocation of bones, and deep wounds (naqibah)\nHe (as) also established the compensation for injuries to all body parts - whether on the head, face, or the rest of the body - including the senses of hearing, vision, and voice.\nHe (as) also established rulings for the intellect (Aql), the hands, and the legs concerning cases of amputation, fractures, cracks, depressions, open wounds (muḍihah), bleeding wounds (damiyah), dislocation of bones, and deep wounds (naqibah).\nIf a bone is broken and heals without any deformity or defect and without any bone being displaced, its compensation is clearly defined.\nIn the case of an open wound (muḍihah) where the bone is exposed but not displaced, both the compensation for the fracture and the open wound are due.\nFor every bone that is broken, there is a set compensation, and for the dislocation of bones, half of the compensation for a fracture is due.\nThe compensation for a visible wound (mudihah) is one-fourth of the compensation for a fracture, particularly for those body parts covered by clothing, except for the two forearm bones (qaṣabatay Al-saʿid) and the fingers.\nFor an ulcer (qarhah) that does not heal, the compensation is one-third of the blood money of the bone where the ulcer is located.\nVision\nIf a man suffers an injury to one of his eyes, its compensation is measured by placing an eggshell over the injured eye and determining the range of vision of the healthy eye. Then, the healthy eye is covered, and the range of vision of the injured eye is assessed. Compensation is calculated based on this comparison.\nThe practice of qasamah (oath-taking) applies in these six categories, involving six individuals according to the degree of injury to the eye.\n- If one-sixth of the vision is lost, the individual alone swears an oath and receives the compensation.\n- If one-third of the vision is lost, he and another man swear and receive the compensation.\n- If half of the vision is lost, he and two other men swear.\n- If two-thirds of the vision is lost, he and three other men swear.\n- If four-fifths of his vision was lost, he would swear an oath along with four other men.\n- If all of his vision was lost, he would swear an oath along with five other men.\nThis was the ruling of qasamah (oath-taking) in the matter of the eye.\nHe (as) also ruled that if someone had no one to swear an oath with him and he was not trusted regarding the extent of his vision loss, the number of oaths he would take would be increased.\n- If one-sixth of his vision was lost, he would swear once;\n- if one-third, he would swear twice;\n- if half, he would swear three times;\n- if two-thirds, he would swear four times;\n- if five-sixths, he would swear five times;\n- and if all of his vision was lost, he would swear six times, after which he would be granted compensation.\nHowever, if he refused to swear, he would only be granted compensation corresponding to what he had sworn for and was trusted upon.\nThe governor (wali) would assist in this matter by investigating, questioning, and verifying in cases of retaliation (qisas), legal punishments (hudud), and equivalent retribution (qawad).\nHearing\nIf a person suffered any harm to his hearing, a similar method would be applied. An object would be used to measure the extent of his hearing loss, and compensation would be determined accordingly. If all of his hearing was lost, it would be handled in the same manner.\nIf there was suspicion of dishonesty, the individual would be left alone until he was caught off-guard, then someone would call out to him. If he responded, his opponents would bring the case back to the judge. The judge would act based on his judgment and could reduce part of the compensation taken.\nThigh or Upper Arm\nIf the damage was in the thigh (fakhidh) or upper arm (Aḍud), it would be measured with a thread by comparing the healthy leg or arm to the injured one to determine the extent of the loss. If the injury was to the shin (saq) or forearm (saʿid), the comparison would be made using the thigh or upper arm.\nThe judge would assess the extent of the injury to the thigh.\nTemple\nHe (as) ruled that if a man sustained an Injury to the Temple (Ṣudgh), causing him to be unable to turn his head except by shifting his entire body, half of the full blood money (diyyah) was due, which is five hundred dinars. If the injury was less severe, the compensation would be calculated accordingly.\nUpper Eyelid\nHe (as) ruled that if the Upper Eyelid (Shufr Al-Ayn Al-Ala) was injured and split, its compensation was one-third of the blood money for the eye, amounting to one hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nLower Eyelid\nIf the Lower Eyelid (Shufr Al-Ayn Al-Asfal) was injured, its compensation was half of the blood money for the eye, which is two hundred fifty dinars.\nEyebrow\nIf the eyebrow (Al-hajib) was injured and all its hair was lost, the compensation was half of the blood money for the eye, amounting to two hundred fifty dinars. For any partial damage, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nNasal Cartilage\nIf the Nasal Cartilage (Rawthah Al-Anf) of the nose was cut off, the compensation was five hundred dinars, which is half of the full blood money.\nThe compiler of this book (may Allah (swt) have mercy on him) explained that the rawthah is the soft, flexible part of the nose.\nNose\nIf there was a penetrating wound in the Nose (Nafidhah) that could not heal, caused by an arrow or spear, the compensation was three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nHowever, if the wound healed completely, the compensation was one-fifth of the blood money for the rawthah of the nose, which is one hundred dinars, with proportional compensation for lesser injuries.\nIf the penetrating wound affected one nostril and extended to the nasal septum (khayshoom), the divider between the nostrils, the compensation was one-tenth of the blood money for the rawthah, which is fifty dinars because the septum represents half.\nIf a projectile passed through one nostril, the septum, and exited through the other nostril, the compensation was sixty-six dinars.\nUpper Lip\nIf the Upper Lip (Al-Shafah Al-Ulya) was completely cut off, its compensation was half of the full blood money, amounting to five hundred dinars.\nFor any portion that was cut, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nIf the upper lip was split and the teeth became visible but the wound healed and closed, the compensation for the injury was one-fifth of the blood money for the lip, which is one hundred dinars. The compensation for any portion of it would be determined accordingly.\nIf the lip was split and became severely disfigured, its compensation was one hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nThe compiler of this book (may Allah (swt) have mercy on him) explained that shatar refers to the splitting of the lip from its lower part, either naturally or due to an injury. A lip in such a condition is referred to as shafah shatraa.\nLower Lip\nIf the Lower Lip (Al-Shafah Al-Sufla) was completely cut off, its compensation was two-thirds of the full blood money, amounting to six hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nFor any part of it that was cut, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nIf it was split, exposing the teeth, and then healed and closed, the compensation was one hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nIf the injury caused severe and ugly disfigurement, the compensation was three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nI asked Abu Jafar Imam Muhammad ibn Ali Al-Baqir (as) about this, and he said: \"It has reached us that the Commander of the Faithful (as) favored the lower lip in compensation because it holds water and food along with the teeth. For this reason, he gave it greater compensation in his rulings.\"\nCheek\nIf there was a penetrating wound in the Cheek (Al-Khadd) that exposed the inside of the mouth, its compensation was one hundred dinars.\nIf the wound healed but left a clear and severe disfigurement, the compensation was fifty dinars.\nIf both cheeks had penetrating wounds, the compensation was one hundred dinars, which is half the compensation for a wound that exposes the mouth.\nWounds with Blades or Arrows\nIf a sharp object, like an arrowhead, became lodged in the bone and penetrated to the palate, the compensation was one hundred fifty dinars - fifty dinars for the visible wound (mudihah) and the rest for the deeper injury.\nIf it was a deep wound (naqibah) that did not fully penetrate, the compensation was one hundred dinars.\nFor any visible wound (mudihah) on the face, the compensation was fifty dinars.\nIf this wound caused disfigurement, the compensation for the disfigurement was one-fourth of the blood money for the visible wound.\nIf there was a wound that did not expose the bone but healed, leaving a scar on the cheeks, the compensation was ten dinars.\nHead and Skull Injuries\nIf there was a fracture (ṣadʿ) in the face, the compensation was eighty dinars.\nIf a piece of flesh fell off without exposing the bone, about the size of a dirham or larger, the compensation was thirty dinars.\nFor a wound that exposed the bone (mudihah) on the body, the compensation was forty dinars, and for the same injury on the head, it was fifty dinars.\nIf the bone was displaced due to the injury, the compensation was one hundred fifty dinars.\nIf there was a penetrating skull wound (naqibah) reaching the brain, known as ma'mumah, and the compensation was one-third of the full blood money, amounting to three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nTeeth Injuries\nFor each tooth that was lost, the compensation was fifty dinars, and all teeth were treated

Indeed, the Commander of the Faithful (as) used to instruct his officials with this.\"\nHe said:\n\"Imam (as) gave a ruling that for every bone that contains marrow, there is a specified obligatory compensation if it is broken and healed without any defect or flaw.\nImam (as) divided the obligatory blood money (diyyah) into six parts and established for wounds, the fetus, the eyelashes, paralysis, limbs, and the thumb, assigning six categories for each.\nFetus\nHe set the blood money for a fetus at one hundred dinars.\nFor the sperm of a man until it becomes a fetus, he set five parts, and when it becomes a fetus before the soul enters it, he set it at one hundred dinars.\nHe allocated twenty dinars for the sperm drop (nutfah), which refers to a man discharging with his wife who does not desire it. Thus, the Commander of the Faithful (as) set this ruling for it.\"\nHe (as) set the compensation for the nutfah (sperm drop) at twenty dinars, which is equivalent to one-fifth (khumus), and for the clot of blood (alaqah), he set it at two-fifths of that, forty dinars. This ruling also applies if a woman is struck or harmed and subsequently miscarries.\n- For the muḍghah (chewed-like lump of flesh), he established sixty dinars if she also miscarried under similar circumstances.\n- For the bone stage (idham), he set eighty dinars if the woman miscarried.\n- For the fully formed fetus (janin), he set one hundred dinars if an enemy attacked them, causing the women to miscarry. He obligated this compensation upon the women from the responsible family (aqilah) accordingly.\nIf a child is born alive and cries (istihlal, the first cry), and they were attacked during the night, leading to the killing of the children, the compensation for each male child is one thousand dinars, and for each female child, it is calculated accordingly at five hundred dinars.\nAs for a woman who is killed while pregnant with a fully formed fetus, and the fetus does not miscarry, and it is unknown whether the fetus is male or female, and whether it died before or after the mother, then the compensation for the fetus is half of the male blood money and half of the female blood money, while the woman's full blood money remains obligatory.\nHe (as) also ruled regarding a man who discharges outside his wife during intercourse without her consent. In this case, he imposed half of one-fifth of the fetus's blood money, amounting to ten dinars.\nIf he discharges inside her without her consent, the compensation is twenty dinars.\nHe established retaliation (qisas) for injuries and the related compensation according to the extent of the blood money, which is one hundred dinars.\nHe ruled on the blood money for fetal injuries proportionally from the scale of one hundred dinars, corresponding to what applies to the injuries of a man or a woman in full.\nSensory Organs and Paralysis\nHe (as) also gave rulings concerning the body.\nHe (as) established six obligatory compensations: life (nafs), vision (baṣar), hearing (samʿ), speech (kalam), impairment of voice due to nasal sound (ghanan) or hoarseness (bahah), and paralysis of the hands and legs.\nHe aligned these rulings with the same principles as the previous laws. Additionally, he prescribed the practice of qasamah (oath-taking) for each of these matters, proportional to the amount of blood money owed.\nFor intentional murder, qasamah involves fifty men, and for accidental killing, twenty-five men, corresponding to the blood money of one thousand dinars for life.\nFor wounds requiring qasamah, six people are involved, and anything less follows this calculation.\nThe qasamah applies to life, hearing, vision, intellect, voice due to hoarseness or harshness, and the loss of hands and legs. These are the six major parts of a person.\nDiyyah - Blood Money\nThe blood money for;\n- a life is one thousand dinars,\n- for the Nose (if completely severed) one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete Total loss of voice (ghanan or bahah) one thousand dinars,\n- for paralysis of both hands one thousand dinars,\n- for the total loss of hearing one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete loss of vision one thousand dinars,\n- for loss of both legs together one thousand dinars,\n- for the Total removal of both lips one thousand dinars,\n- for a severe bent hunchback of the back thousand dinars,\n- for the Complete severance of the male genital organ one thousand dinars,\n- for the complete removal of the tongue one thousand dinars,\n- for Loss of both testicles one thousand dinars.\nInjuries; amputation, fractures, cracks, depressions, open wounds (muḍihah), bleeding wounds (damiyah), dislocation of bones, and deep wounds (naqibah)\nHe (as) also established the compensation for injuries to all body parts - whether on the head, face, or the rest of the body - including the senses of hearing, vision, and voice.\nHe (as) also established rulings for the intellect (Aql), the hands, and the legs concerning cases of amputation, fractures, cracks, depressions, open wounds (muḍihah), bleeding wounds (damiyah), dislocation of bones, and deep wounds (naqibah).\nIf a bone is broken and heals without any deformity or defect and without any bone being displaced, its compensation is clearly defined.\nIn the case of an open wound (muḍihah) where the bone is exposed but not displaced, both the compensation for the fracture and the open wound are due.\nFor every bone that is broken, there is a set compensation, and for the dislocation of bones, half of the compensation for a fracture is due.\nThe compensation for a visible wound (mudihah) is one-fourth of the compensation for a fracture, particularly for those body parts covered by clothing, except for the two forearm bones (qaṣabatay Al-saʿid) and the fingers.\nFor an ulcer (qarhah) that does not heal, the compensation is one-third of the blood money of the bone where the ulcer is located.\nVision\nIf a man suffers an injury to one of his eyes, its compensation is measured by placing an eggshell over the injured eye and determining the range of vision of the healthy eye. Then, the healthy eye is covered, and the range of vision of the injured eye is assessed. Compensation is calculated based on this comparison.\nThe practice of qasamah (oath-taking) applies in these six categories, involving six individuals according to the degree of injury to the eye.\n- If one-sixth of the vision is lost, the individual alone swears an oath and receives the compensation.\n- If one-third of the vision is lost, he and another man swear and receive the compensation.\n- If half of the vision is lost, he and two other men swear.\n- If two-thirds of the vision is lost, he and three other men swear.\n- If four-fifths of his vision was lost, he would swear an oath along with four other men.\n- If all of his vision was lost, he would swear an oath along with five other men.\nThis was the ruling of qasamah (oath-taking) in the matter of the eye.\nHe (as) also ruled that if someone had no one to swear an oath with him and he was not trusted regarding the extent of his vision loss, the number of oaths he would take would be increased.\n- If one-sixth of his vision was lost, he would swear once;\n- if one-third, he would swear twice;\n- if half, he would swear three times;\n- if two-thirds, he would swear four times;\n- if five-sixths, he would swear five times;\n- and if all of his vision was lost, he would swear six times, after which he would be granted compensation.\nHowever, if he refused to swear, he would only be granted compensation corresponding to what he had sworn for and was trusted upon.\nThe governor (wali) would assist in this matter by investigating, questioning, and verifying in cases of retaliation (qisas), legal punishments (hudud), and equivalent retribution (qawad).\nHearing\nIf a person suffered any harm to his hearing, a similar method would be applied. An object would be used to measure the extent of his hearing loss, and compensation would be determined accordingly. If all of his hearing was lost, it would be handled in the same manner.\nIf there was suspicion of dishonesty, the individual would be left alone until he was caught off-guard, then someone would call out to him. If he responded, his opponents would bring the case back to the judge. The judge would act based on his judgment and could reduce part of the compensation taken.\nThigh or Upper Arm\nIf the damage was in the thigh (fakhidh) or upper arm (Aḍud), it would be measured with a thread by comparing the healthy leg or arm to the injured one to determine the extent of the loss. If the injury was to the shin (saq) or forearm (saʿid), the comparison would be made using the thigh or upper arm.\nThe judge would assess the extent of the injury to the thigh.\nTemple\nHe (as) ruled that if a man sustained an Injury to the Temple (Ṣudgh), causing him to be unable to turn his head except by shifting his entire body, half of the full blood money (diyyah) was due, which is five hundred dinars. If the injury was less severe, the compensation would be calculated accordingly.\nUpper Eyelid\nHe (as) ruled that if the Upper Eyelid (Shufr Al-Ayn Al-Ala) was injured and split, its compensation was one-third of the blood money for the eye, amounting to one hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nLower Eyelid\nIf the Lower Eyelid (Shufr Al-Ayn Al-Asfal) was injured, its compensation was half of the blood money for the eye, which is two hundred fifty dinars.\nEyebrow\nIf the eyebrow (Al-hajib) was injured and all its hair was lost, the compensation was half of the blood money for the eye, amounting to two hundred fifty dinars. For any partial damage, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nNasal Cartilage\nIf the Nasal Cartilage (Rawthah Al-Anf) of the nose was cut off, the compensation was five hundred dinars, which is half of the full blood money.\nThe compiler of this book (may Allah (swt) have mercy on him) explained that the rawthah is the soft, flexible part of the nose.\nNose\nIf there was a penetrating wound in the Nose (Nafidhah) that could not heal, caused by an arrow or spear, the compensation was three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nHowever, if the wound healed completely, the compensation was one-fifth of the blood money for the rawthah of the nose, which is one hundred dinars, with proportional compensation for lesser injuries.\nIf the penetrating wound affected one nostril and extended to the nasal septum (khayshoom), the divider between the nostrils, the compensation was one-tenth of the blood money for the rawthah, which is fifty dinars because the septum represents half.\nIf a projectile passed through one nostril, the septum, and exited through the other nostril, the compensation was sixty-six dinars.\nUpper Lip\nIf the Upper Lip (Al-Shafah Al-Ulya) was completely cut off, its compensation was half of the full blood money, amounting to five hundred dinars.\nFor any portion that was cut, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nIf the upper lip was split and the teeth became visible but the wound healed and closed, the compensation for the injury was one-fifth of the blood money for the lip, which is one hundred dinars. The compensation for any portion of it would be determined accordingly.\nIf the lip was split and became severely disfigured, its compensation was one hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nThe compiler of this book (may Allah (swt) have mercy on him) explained that shatar refers to the splitting of the lip from its lower part, either naturally or due to an injury. A lip in such a condition is referred to as shafah shatraa.\nLower Lip\nIf the Lower Lip (Al-Shafah Al-Sufla) was completely cut off, its compensation was two-thirds of the full blood money, amounting to six hundred sixty-six and two-thirds dinars.\nFor any part of it that was cut, the compensation would be calculated proportionally.\nIf it was split, exposing the teeth, and then healed and closed, the compensation was one hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nIf the injury caused severe and ugly disfigurement, the compensation was three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nI asked Abu Jafar Imam Muhammad ibn Ali Al-Baqir (as) about this, and he said: \"It has reached us that the Commander of the Faithful (as) favored the lower lip in compensation because it holds water and food along with the teeth. For this reason, he gave it greater compensation in his rulings.\"\nCheek\nIf there was a penetrating wound in the Cheek (Al-Khadd) that exposed the inside of the mouth, its compensation was one hundred dinars.\nIf the wound healed but left a clear and severe disfigurement, the compensation was fifty dinars.\nIf both cheeks had penetrating wounds, the compensation was one hundred dinars, which is half the compensation for a wound that exposes the mouth.\nWounds with Blades or Arrows\nIf a sharp object, like an arrowhead, became lodged in the bone and penetrated to the palate, the compensation was one hundred fifty dinars - fifty dinars for the visible wound (mudihah) and the rest for the deeper injury.\nIf it was a deep wound (naqibah) that did not fully penetrate, the compensation was one hundred dinars.\nFor any visible wound (mudihah) on the face, the compensation was fifty dinars.\nIf this wound caused disfigurement, the compensation for the disfigurement was one-fourth of the blood money for the visible wound.\nIf there was a wound that did not expose the bone but healed, leaving a scar on the cheeks, the compensation was ten dinars.\nHead and Skull Injuries\nIf there was a fracture (ṣadʿ) in the face, the compensation was eighty dinars.\nIf a piece of flesh fell off without exposing the bone, about the size of a dirham or larger, the compensation was thirty dinars.\nFor a wound that exposed the bone (mudihah) on the body, the compensation was forty dinars, and for the same injury on the head, it was fifty dinars.\nIf the bone was displaced due to the injury, the compensation was one hundred fifty dinars.\nIf there was a penetrating skull wound (naqibah) reaching the brain, known as ma'mumah, and the compensation was one-third of the full blood money, amounting to three hundred thirty-three and one-third dinars.\nTeeth Injuries\nFor each tooth that was lost, the compensation was fifty dinars, and all teeth were treated equally in compensation;\n- the compensation for the central incisor (thaniyyah) was set at fifty dinars.\n- the compensation for the lateral incisor (rabaʿiyyah) was forty dinars,\n- for the canine tooth (nawb) it was thirty dinars,\n- and for the molar tooth (dars) it was twenty-five dinars.\n- If a tooth turned black within a year but did not fall out, its compensation was equal to that of a

Every thin layer is called simhaq. This term is also used to describe thin clouds in the sky (samaʾ samahiq) and thin layers of fat on a sheep.\nFollowing that is the muḍihah, which exposes and reveals the bone.\nThen comes the hashimah, which crushes the bone.\nAfter that is the munaqqilah, which shatters the bone into pieces, causing fragments (farash Al-ʿiẓam) - thin layers that remain on the bone beneath the flesh. The poet Al-Nabighah referenced this in his verse: \"And following them are the thin fragments of their brows.\"\nThen is the maʾmumah, which reaches the protective covering of the head (umm Al-raʾs), the membrane covering the brain.\nAmong other types of wounds are the jaʾifah, which penetrates into the internal body cavity or, in the case of the head, reaches the brain.",

Umar handed him over to the victim's brother and ordered him to kill him. The man struck him until he thought he had killed him. He was carried to his home, and they found he still had some life in him.\nThey treated him until he recovered. When he recovered, the brother of the first murdered man seized him and said:\n\"You are the killer of my brother, and I have the right to kill you.\"\nThe man replied: \"You have already killed me once.\"\nHe was then brought before Umar, who ordered his execution.\nAs he was being taken away, he cried out:\n\"O' people, by Allah (swt), he has already killed me once!\"\nThey passed by Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) and informed him of the situation.\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said: \"Do not rush to kill him until I come out to you.\"\nImam (as) entered upon Umar and said: \"This is not the correct ruling in this matter.\"\nUmar asked: \"Then what is it, O' Abu Al-Hasan (as)?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"This man should exact retribution from the brother of the first murdered man for what he did to him, and then he can be executed for his brother.\"\nThe man thought that if he took retribution, it would lead to his own death, so he pardoned him, and they both left each other in peace.\n[BOOK=BOOK ON BEQUESTS (WASIYYAH)]\nكِتَابُ الْوَصِيَّةِ",

Then Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) handed over to him (Imam Hasan ibn Ali (as)) the book and the weapon, and Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said:\n'O' my son, the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) commanded me to appoint you as my successor and to hand over to you my books and my weapon, just as he appointed me and handed over his books and his weapon to me. He (sw) also commanded me to instruct you that when death approaches you, you should hand them over to your brother Al- Hussain (as).'\nThen he turned to his son Imam Hussain ibn Ali (as) and said:\n'And the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) commanded you to hand it over to your son Ali ibn Al- Hussain (as).'\nThen he turned to his son Imam Ali ibn Al-Hussain (as) and said:\n'And the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) commanded you to hand your will over to your son Muhammad ibn Ali (as). Convey to him the greetings of peace from the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) and from me.'\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) turned to his son Imam Hasan ibn Ali (as) and said:\n'O' my son, you are the guardian of the matter and the avenger of the blood. If you forgive, it is your right, and if you choose to retaliate, then strike only as you were struck, and do not transgress.'\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said:\n'Write: In the name of Allah (swt), the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. This is what Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) bequeathed.\nHe (as) bears witness that there is no God but Allah (swt), alone without partner, and that Muhammad (sw) is His (swt) servant and Messenger, whom He (swt) sent with guidance and the religion of truth so that He (swt) may make it prevail over all religions, even if the polytheists dislike it.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) continued:\n\"Indeed, my prayer, my sacrifice, my life, and my death are for Allah (swt), the Lord (azj) of the worlds. He (swt) has no partner, and with this I have been commanded, and I am among the Muslims.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said:\n\"I advise you, O' Hasan (as), and all of my children, my household, and everyone who receives this letter from among the believers to fear Allah (swt), your Lord (azj), and do not die except while you are Muslims.'\nAnd hold firmly to the rope of Allah (swt) all together and do not become divided. Remember Allah's (swt) favor upon you when you were enemies, and He (swt) brought your hearts together.'\nIndeed, I heard the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) say: Reconciliation between people is better than most prayers and fasting.'\nHatred destroys religion, and corruption between people is destructive. There is no power except with Allah (swt).'\nTake care of your relatives and maintain ties with them, for Allah (swt) will make your reckoning easier.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of orphans - do not let their mouths hunger, and do not let them be neglected in your presence. For I heard the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) say: 'Whoever takes care of an orphan until they become self-sufficient, Allah (swt) will make Paradise obligatory for them, just as He (swt) has made the Fire obligatory for one who consumes the property of an orphan.'\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) continued:\n\"By Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the Qur'an. Let no one surpass you in acting upon it.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of your neighbours, for Allah (swt) and His Messenger have both advised concerning them.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the House of your Lord (azj). Do not let it be abandoned as long as you live, for if it is neglected, you will be forsaken. The least reward one receives upon visiting it is that past sins are forgiven.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of prayer, for it is the best of deeds and the pillar of your religion.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of zakat, for it extinguishes the anger of your Lord (azj).\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of fasting during the month of Ramadan, for fasting is a shield against the Fire.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the poor and the needy. Include them in your livelihood.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of jihad in the way of Allah (swt) with your wealth and your lives. Indeed, the one who truly strives in the way of Allah (swt) is either a guiding leader or one who obeys him and follows his guidance.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the progeny of your Prophet (sw). Do not let them be wronged while they are among you and you have the power to defend them.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the companions of your Prophet (sw) - those who did not commit innovations and did not support innovators. For the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) advised regarding them and cursed the one who innovates among them or others and those who support innovators.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of women and those whom your right hands possess. Do not fear the blame of the blamers when it comes to Allah (swt). Allah (swt) will suffice you against those who wish you harm and plot against you.\nSpeak kindly to people' as Allah (swt), the Exalted, has commanded you.\nDo not neglect enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, lest Allah (swt) gives authority to the worst among you. Then you will pray, and your prayers will not be answered.\nO' my children! Maintain ties with one another, be generous to one another, and be kind to each other. Beware of severing ties, turning your backs on one another, and division.\nCooperate in righteousness and piety, and do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah (swt); indeed, Allah (swt) is severe in punishment.'\nMay Allah (swt) protect you, O' people of my household, and preserve through you your Prophet (sw). I entrust you to Allah (swt) and convey my peace upon you.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) continued to say: \"There is no God but Allah (swt),\" until he passed away - peace and blessings be upon him - in the early night of the last ten nights, on the twenty-first night of the month of Ramadan, on a Friday night, in the fortieth year after the Hijrah.",

		"thaqalaynMatn": "\"I witnessed the will of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) when he appointed his son Imam Hasan ibn Ali (as) as his successor and made Imam Hussain ibn Ali (as), Muhammad (Hanafiya), all of his children, the prominent members of his household, and his followers (Shi'a) witnesses to his will. Then Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) handed over to him (Imam Hasan ibn Ali (as)) the book and the weapon, and Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said:\n'O' my son, the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) commanded me to appoint you as my successor and to hand over to you my books and my weapon, just as he appointed me and handed over his books and his weapon to me. He (sw) also commanded me to instruct you that when death approaches you, you should hand them over to your brother Al- Hussain (as).'\nThen he turned to his son Imam Hussain ibn Ali (as) and said:\n'And the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) commanded you to hand it over to your son Ali ibn Al- Hussain (as).'\nThen he turned to his son Imam Ali ibn Al-Hussain (as) and said:\n'And the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) commanded you to hand your will over to your son Muhammad ibn Ali (as). Convey to him the greetings of peace from the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) and from me.'\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) turned to his son Imam Hasan ibn Ali (as) and said:\n'O' my son, you are the guardian of the matter and the avenger of the blood. If you forgive, it is your right, and if you choose to retaliate, then strike only as you were struck, and do not transgress.'\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said:\n'Write: In the name of Allah (swt), the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. This is what Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) bequeathed.\nHe (as) bears witness that there is no God but Allah (swt), alone without partner, and that Muhammad (sw) is His (swt) servant and Messenger, whom He (swt) sent with guidance and the religion of truth so that He (swt) may make it prevail over all religions, even if the polytheists dislike it.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) continued:\n\"Indeed, my prayer, my sacrifice, my life, and my death are for Allah (swt), the Lord (azj) of the worlds. He (swt) has no partner, and with this I have been commanded, and I am among the Muslims.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said:\n\"I advise you, O' Hasan (as), and all of my children, my household, and everyone who receives this letter from among the believers to fear Allah (swt), your Lord (azj), and do not die except while you are Muslims.'\nAnd hold firmly to the rope of Allah (swt) all together and do not become divided. Remember Allah's (swt) favor upon you when you were enemies, and He (swt) brought your hearts together.'\nIndeed, I heard the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) say: Reconciliation between people is better than most prayers and fasting.'\nHatred destroys religion, and corruption between people is destructive. There is no power except with Allah (swt).'\nTake care of your relatives and maintain ties with them, for Allah (swt) will make your reckoning easier.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of orphans - do not let their mouths hunger, and do not let them be neglected in your presence. For I heard the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) say: 'Whoever takes care of an orphan until they become self-sufficient, Allah (swt) will make Paradise obligatory for them, just as He (swt) has made the Fire obligatory for one who consumes the property of an orphan.'\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) continued:\n\"By Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the Qur'an. Let no one surpass you in acting upon it.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of your neighbours, for Allah (swt) and His Messenger have both advised concerning them.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the House of your Lord (azj). Do not let it be abandoned as long as you live, for if it is neglected, you will be forsaken. The least reward one receives upon visiting it is that past sins are forgiven.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of prayer, for it is the best of deeds and the pillar of your religion.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of zakat, for it extinguishes the anger of your Lord (azj).\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of fasting during the month of Ramadan, for fasting is a shield against the Fire.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the poor and the needy. Include them in your livelihood.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of jihad in the way of Allah (swt) with your wealth and your lives. Indeed, the one who truly strives in the way of Allah (swt) is either a guiding leader or one who obeys him and follows his guidance.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the progeny of your Prophet (sw). Do not let them be wronged while they are among you and you have the power to defend them.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of the companions of your Prophet (sw) - those who did not commit innovations and did not support innovators. For the Messenger of Allah (swt) (peace be upon him and his family) advised regarding them and cursed the one who innovates among them or others and those who support innovators.\nBy Allah (swt), by Allah (swt), be mindful of women and those whom your right hands possess. Do not fear the blame of the blamers when it comes to Allah (swt). Allah (swt) will suffice you against those who wish you harm and plot against you.\nSpeak kindly to people' as Allah (swt), the Exalted, has commanded you.\nDo not neglect enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, lest Allah (swt) gives authority to the worst among you. Then you will pray, and your prayers will not be answered.\nO' my children! Maintain ties with one another, be generous to one another, and be kind to each other. Beware of severing ties, turning your backs on one another, and division.\nCooperate in righteousness and piety, and do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah (swt); indeed, Allah (swt) is severe in punishment.'\nMay Allah (swt) protect you, O' people of my household, and preserve through you your Prophet (sw). I entrust you to Allah (swt) and convey my peace upon you.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) continued to say: \"There is no God but Allah (swt),\" until he passed away - peace and blessings be upon him - in the early night of the last ten nights, on the twenty-first night of the month of Ramadan, on a Friday night, in the fortieth year after the Hijrah.",

Witnesses between you when death approaches one of you, at the time of bequest, are two just men from among you, or two others from outside of you.\"\n(Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:106)\nImam (as) said: \"The two from among you are Muslims, and the two from outside of you are from the People of the Book (Ahl Al-Kitab).\nIf you do not find two from the People of the Book, then from the Magians (Zoroastrians), because within the Magians is a tradition similar to the People of the Book regarding the jizyah (tax).\nThis applies when a man dies in a foreign land and no two Muslims are present. In such a case, two men from the People of the Book are made witnesses. They are detained after the Asr prayer and must swear by Allah (swt) if you doubt them:\n'We will not sell our testimony for any price, even if it is for a near relative, and we will not conceal the testimony of Allah (swt), for then we would indeed be among the sinful.'\"\n(Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:106)\nImam (as) said: \"This applies if the guardian of the deceased doubts their testimony. If it is discovered that they gave false testimony, he cannot nullify their testimony unless he brings two other witnesses. These two will then take the place of the first two witnesses and swear by Allah (swt):\n'Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed; indeed, we would then be among the wrongdoers.'

Witnesses between you when death approaches one of you, at the time of bequest, are two just men from among you, or two others from outside of you.\"\n(Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:106)\nImam (as) said: \"The two from among you are Muslims, and the two from outside of you are from the People of the Book (Ahl Al-Kitab).\nIf you do not find two from the People of the Book, then from the Magians (Zoroastrians), because within the Magians is a tradition similar to the People of the Book regarding the jizyah (tax).\nThis applies when a man dies in a foreign land and no two Muslims are present. In such a case, two men from the People of the Book are made witnesses. They are detained after the Asr prayer and must swear by Allah (swt) if you doubt them:\n'We will not sell our testimony for any price, even if it is for a near relative, and we will not conceal the testimony of Allah (swt), for then we would indeed be among the sinful.'\"\n(Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:106)\nImam (as) said: \"This applies if the guardian of the deceased doubts their testimony. If it is discovered that they gave false testimony, he cannot nullify their testimony unless he brings two other witnesses. These two will then take the place of the first two witnesses and swear by Allah (swt):\n'Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed; indeed, we would then be among the wrongdoers.' (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:107)\nIf they do this, the testimony of the first two witnesses is annulled, and the testimony of the second pair is accepted.\nAllah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, says:\n'This is more likely to ensure that they give their testimony properly or fear that oaths will be taken after their oaths.' (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:108)\"",

I then said to him:\n\"I have complained about you to Imam Jafar ibn Muhammad Al-Sadiq (as), peace be upon him, and He (as) told me such and such.\"\nIbn Abi Layla made me swear that Abu Abdullah Imam Jafar ibn Muhammad Al-Sadiq (as) had indeed said that. I swore to him, and as a result, he ruled in my favor accordingly.",

The same applies if there are two or more sons - the remaining portion after distributing the shares to the wife and parents is divided equally among the sons.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a wife, both parents, and a daughter, the wife receives one-eighth, each parent receives one-sixth, and the daughter receives half of the estate. Any remaining amount is proportionally returned (radd) to the daughter and the parents according to their original shares. However, no additional amount is returned to the wife or the husband.\nThis distribution is calculated out of twenty-four parts due to the one-eighth share. After subtracting the wife's one-eighth, the two parents' one-sixth each, and the daughter's half, one remaining share is left. Since this cannot be evenly divided among five recipients, the entire estate is multiplied by five, making it 120 shares. The wife receives one-eighth, totaling 15 shares, the parents receive a combined 40 shares, and the daughter receives 60 shares. The remaining five shares are distributed - three additional shares go to the daughter, making her total 63 shares, and two shares go to the parents, totaling 42 shares for both.\nSimilarly, if a man dies and leaves behind a wife, two or more daughters, and both parents, the wife receives one-eighth, the parents each receive one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the daughters. The concept of awl (adjusting the shares to fit the total inheritance) does not apply here because if the daughters had been sons, they would have only received what was left over.",

		"englishText": "If a woman passes away and leaves behind her husband and both parents, the inheritance is distributed as follows: the husband receives half of the estate, the mother receives one-third in full, and the remaining portion goes to the father, which amounts to one-sixth.\nThis distribution aligns with the verse of Allah (swt) Almighty: \"But if he has no child and his parents inherit from him, then for his mother is one-third\" (Surah An-Nisa 4:11).\nAllah (swt) granted the mother a complete one-third share when there are no children or siblings.\nAl-Fadl explains that this is evident because even those who disagree with this ruling do not assign the mother one-sixth in this scenario. Instead, they claim the mother receives one-third of what remains after the husband's share, which effectively equals one-sixth. They sought to adhere to the wording of the Quran but deviated from its intended ruling, which is misleading and contrary to Allah's (swt) Book.\nSimilarly, in the inheritance scenario where a woman dies leaving behind her husband and both parents, the husband receives one-fourth, the mother receives one-third, and the remainder goes to the father. Allah (swt) explicitly mentioned in the Quran the shares for the husband and wife but did not specify a portion for the father, indicating that the father inherits what remains after the specified shares are distributed. This ensures that the father's inheritance comes from what is left after the fixed shares have been allocated.",

		"englishText": "Hadith.5621 - The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his family) said:\n\"The full siblings from the same mother are more entitled to inheritance than the paternal half-siblings.\"\n[AL SADUQ]\nIf a person leaves behind full sisters (from the same father and mother), paternal sisters (from the same father only), and a paternal nephew, then the full sisters are entitled to two-thirds of the inheritance, and the remainder is also returned to them, as they are the closest in kinship.\nIf the deceased leaves a paternal brother and a paternal nephew from both parents, then the entire estate belongs to the paternal brother, as he is closer by one degree. The paternal brother takes the place of a full brother (from both parents) if no such full brother exists. Since he stands in the position of the full brother and is closer by one degree, he has a stronger claim to the inheritance than the nephew.\nIf the deceased leaves a full brother and a maternal brother, the maternal brother receives one-sixth, and the remainder belongs to the full brother.\nIf a person leaves full siblings (brothers and sisters) and a maternal sister, the maternal sister receives one-sixth, and the remainder is distributed among the full siblings, with the male receiving twice the share of the female.\nIf the deceased leaves a full sister and a maternal brother or sister, the maternal sibling receives one-sixth, and the full sister takes the remainder.\nIf the deceased leaves two or more maternal siblings and full siblings, the maternal siblings collectively receive one-third of the estate, divided equally among them, regardless of gender. The remainder belongs to the full siblings.\nIf there is only one maternal sibling, whether male or female, they receive one-sixth of the inheritance. If there are two or more maternal siblings, whether male or female, they collectively share one-third of the inheritance, and they are not entitled to more than one-third of the estate.\nAnd they shall not be given less than a sixth if there is only one.\nAllah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, said: \"And if a man or a woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister, each one of them shall have a sixth; but if they are more than that, they shall share in a third.\"\nIf he leaves behind his paternal brother, his maternal brother, and his paternal and maternal brother, the maternal brother shall receive one-sixth, and whatever remains shall belong to the paternal and maternal brother, and the paternal brother shall be excluded.\nIf he leaves behind maternal brothers and sisters, paternal and maternal brothers and sisters, and paternal brothers and sisters, the maternal brothers and sisters shall have a third, with males and females being equal, and whatever remains shall belong to the paternal and maternal brothers and sisters, with the male receiving twice the share of the female, and the paternal siblings shall be excluded.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal sister, a paternal and maternal sister, and a paternal sister, the maternal sister shall receive one-sixth, and whatever remains shall belong to the paternal and maternal sister, and the paternal sister shall be excluded. If he leaves behind two maternal sisters, two paternal and maternal sisters, and two paternal sisters, the maternal sisters shall receive a third equally between them, and whatever remains shall belong to the paternal and maternal sisters, and the paternal sisters shall be excluded.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal and maternal sister, maternal brothers and sisters, and the son of a paternal and maternal brother, the maternal brothers and sisters shall have a third, with males and females being equal.\nAnd whatever remains shall belong to the sister from the father and mother, and the son of the brother from the father and mother shall be excluded. If he leaves behind a brother from the father and a nephew from the mother, then the entire inheritance belongs to the brother from the father. If he leaves behind a brother from the mother and a nephew from the father and mother, then the entire inheritance belongs to the brother from the mother, and the nephew from the father and mother shall be excluded.\nAl-Fadl ibn Shadhan erred in this issue and said that the brother from the mother shall receive the sixth, which is his designated share, and whatever remains shall go to the nephew from the father and mother. He supported this with a weak argument, saying that the nephew from the father and mother takes the place of the brother who would have been entitled to the entire inheritance according to the Book, and thus he is like the brother from the father and mother and has the additional tie of kinship through the mother.\nThe compiler of this book, may Allah (swt) have mercy on him, said that the nephew only takes the place of the brother if there is no brother. If there is a brother, then he does not take the place of the brother, just as the son of a son is considered a son only if the deceased has no son or parents.\nIf analogy (qiyas) were permissible in the religion of Allah (swt), the Exalted, then if a man left behind a brother from the father and a nephew from the father and mother, the entire inheritance would belong to the nephew from the father and mother by analogy to the paternal uncle.\nAnd the cousin from the father and mother, for the entire estate belongs to the cousin from the father and mother because he combines both paternal and maternal ties. This is based on the transmitted report from the Imams, peace be upon them, to whom submission is obligatory.\nAl-Fadl states in this matter that the estate belongs to the brother from the father, and the nephew from the father and mother is excluded. According to his analogy, the estate should be divided between the nephew from the father and mother and the brother from the father because the nephew from the father and mother has the advantage of a closer maternal connection, and he is related to the one who is entitled to the entire inheritance by designation, as well as to the one who does not inherit alongside the brother from the father.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a nephew from the mother, a nephew from the father and mother, and a nephew from the father, the nephew from the mother shall receive one-sixth, and the remainder shall go to the nephew from the father and mother, while the nephew from the father shall be excluded.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a nephew from the father and a nephew from the father and mother, the entire estate belongs to the nephew from the father and mother, and the nephew from the father shall be excluded.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a niece from the mother, a niece from the father and mother, and a niece from the father, the niece from the mother shall receive one-sixth, and the remainder shall belong to the niece from the father and mother.\nAnd the remaining share belongs to the niece from the father and mother, while the niece from the father is excluded. If the deceased leaves behind a niece from the father and mother and the sons of a brother from the father and mother, if they are from the same brother, the inheritance is divided among them with the share of a male being equal to that of two females. However, if the niece's father is different from the father of the sons of the brother, then the niece inherits half of the estate as the share of her father, and the sons of the brother inherit the other half as their father's share.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a nephew from the mother and the great-grandson of a nephew from the father and mother, the entire estate belongs to the nephew from the mother, as he is closer. Contrary to what Al-Fadl ibn Shadhan stated, the nephew from the mother does not inherit only one-sixth while the remainder goes to the great-grandson of the nephew from the father and mother. Such a claim contradicts the foundational principle upon which Allah (swt), the Almighty, has established the rules of inheritance.\nIf the deceased leaves behind the great-grandson of a nephew from the father and mother, or from the father, or from the mother, along with an uncle, an aunt, a maternal uncle, or a maternal aunt, the estate belongs to the great-grandson of the nephew from the father and mother. This is because the descendants of a brother, even if distant, are considered from the line of the father, while an uncle and aunt are from the line of the grandfather, and a maternal uncle and maternal aunt are also from the line of the grandfather. The descendants of the father, even if distant, have a stronger claim to inheritance than the descendants of the grandfather.\nSimilarly, the same rule applies to the children of a sister, whether she is from the father, the mother, or both. They are given precedence, and no uncle, aunt, maternal uncle, or maternal aunt inherits alongside them. Just as the presence of a grandchild, even if distant, excludes siblings from inheriting, whether they are from the father, the mother, or both.",

		"thaqalaynMatn": "\"The full siblings from the same mother are more entitled to inheritance than the paternal half-siblings.\"\n[AL SADUQ]\nIf a person leaves behind full sisters (from the same father and mother), paternal sisters (from the same father only), and a paternal nephew, then the full sisters are entitled to two-thirds of the inheritance, and the remainder is also returned to them, as they are the closest in kinship.\nIf the deceased leaves a paternal brother and a paternal nephew from both parents, then the entire estate belongs to the paternal brother, as he is closer by one degree. The paternal brother takes the place of a full brother (from both parents) if no such full brother exists. Since he stands in the position of the full brother and is closer by one degree, he has a stronger claim to the inheritance than the nephew.\nIf the deceased leaves a full brother and a maternal brother, the maternal brother receives one-sixth, and the remainder belongs to the full brother.\nIf a person leaves full siblings (brothers and sisters) and a maternal sister, the maternal sister receives one-sixth, and the remainder is distributed among the full siblings, with the male receiving twice the share of the female.\nIf the deceased leaves a full sister and a maternal brother or sister, the maternal sibling receives one-sixth, and the full sister takes the remainder.\nIf the deceased leaves two or more maternal siblings and full siblings, the maternal siblings collectively receive one-third of the estate, divided equally among them, regardless of gender. The remainder belongs to the full siblings.\nIf there is only one maternal sibling, whether male or female, they receive one-sixth of the inheritance. If there are two or more maternal siblings, whether male or female, they collectively share one-third of the inheritance, and they are not entitled to more than one-third of the estate.\nAnd they shall not be given less than a sixth if there is only one.\nAllah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, said: \"And if a man or a woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister, each one of them shall have a sixth; but if they are more than that, they shall share in a third.\"\nIf he leaves behind his paternal brother, his maternal brother, and his paternal and maternal brother, the maternal brother shall receive one-sixth, and whatever remains shall belong to the paternal and maternal brother, and the paternal brother shall be excluded.\nIf he leaves behind maternal brothers and sisters, paternal and maternal brothers and sisters, and paternal brothers and sisters, the maternal brothers and sisters shall have a third, with males and females being equal, and whatever remains shall belong to the paternal and maternal brothers and sisters, with the male receiving twice the share of the female, and the paternal siblings shall be excluded.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal sister, a paternal and maternal sister, and a paternal sister, the maternal sister shall receive one-sixth, and whatever remains shall belong to the paternal and maternal sister, and the paternal sister shall be excluded. If he leaves behind two maternal sisters, two paternal and maternal sisters, and two paternal sisters, the maternal sisters shall receive a third equally between them, and whatever remains shall belong to the paternal and maternal sisters, and the paternal sisters shall be excluded.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal and maternal sister, maternal brothers and sisters, and the son of a paternal and maternal brother, the maternal brothers and sisters shall have a third, with males and females being equal.\nAnd whatever remains shall belong to the sister from the father and mother, and the son of the brother from the father and mother shall be excluded. If he leaves behind a brother from the father and a nephew from the mother, then the entire inheritance belongs to the brother from the father. If he leaves behind a brother from the mother and a nephew from the father and mother, then the entire inheritance belongs to the brother from the mother, and the nephew from the father and mother shall be excluded.\nAl-Fadl ibn Shadhan erred in this issue and said that the brother from the mother shall receive the sixth, which is his designated share, and whatever remains shall go to the nephew from the father and mother. He supported this with a weak argument, saying that the nephew from the father and mother takes the place of the brother who would have been entitled to the entire inheritance according to the Book, and thus he is like the brother from the father and mother and has the additional tie of kinship through the mother.\nThe compiler of this book, may Allah (swt) have mercy on him, said that the nephew only takes the place of the brother if there is no brother. If there is a brother, then he does not take the place of the brother, just as the son of a son is considered a son only if the deceased has no son or parents.\nIf analogy (qiyas) were permissible in the religion of Allah (swt), the Exalted, then if a man left behind a brother from the father and a nephew from the father and mother, the entire inheritance would belong to the nephew from the father and mother by analogy to the paternal uncle.\nAnd the cousin from the father and mother, for the entire estate belongs to the cousin from the father and mother because he combines both paternal and maternal ties. This is based on the transmitted report from the Imams, peace be upon them, to whom submission is obligatory.\nAl-Fadl states in this matter that the estate belongs to the brother from the father, and the nephew from the father and mother is excluded. According to his analogy, the estate should be divided between the nephew from the father and mother and the brother from the father because the nephew from the father and mother has the advantage of a closer maternal connection, and he is related to the one who is entitled to the entire inheritance by designation, as well as to the one who does not inherit alongside the brother from the father.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a nephew from the mother, a nephew from the father and mother, and a nephew from the father, the nephew from the mother shall receive one-sixth, and the remainder shall go to the nephew from the father and mother, while the nephew from the father shall be excluded.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a nephew from the father and a nephew from the father and mother, the entire estate belongs to the nephew from the father and mother, and the nephew from the father shall be excluded.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a niece from the mother, a niece from the father and mother, and a niece from the father, the niece from the mother shall receive one-sixth, and the remainder shall belong to the niece from the father and mother.\nAnd the remaining share belongs to the niece from the father and mother, while the niece from the father is excluded. If the deceased leaves behind a niece from the father and mother and the sons of a brother from the father and mother, if they are from the same brother, the inheritance is divided among them with the share of a male being equal to that of two females. However, if the niece's father is different from the father of the sons of the brother, then the niece inherits half of the estate as the share of her father, and the sons of the brother inherit the other half as their father's share.\nIf the deceased leaves behind a nephew from the mother and the great-grandson of a nephew from the father and mother, the entire estate belongs to the nephew from the mother, as he is closer. Contrary to what Al-Fadl ibn Shadhan stated, the nephew from the mother does not inherit only one-sixth while the remainder goes to the great-grandson of the nephew from the father and mother. Such a claim contradicts the foundational principle upon which Allah (swt), the Almighty, has established the rules of inheritance.\nIf the deceased leaves behind the great-grandson of a nephew from the father and mother, or from the father, or from the mother, along with an uncle, an aunt, a maternal uncle, or a maternal aunt, the estate belongs to the great-grandson of the nephew from the father and mother. This is because the descendants of a brother, even if distant, are considered from the line of the father, while an uncle and aunt are from the line of the grandfather, and a maternal uncle and maternal aunt are also from the line of the grandfather. The descendants of the father, even if distant, have a stronger claim to inheritance than the descendants of the grandfather.\nSimilarly, the same rule applies to the children of a sister, whether she is from the father, the mother, or both. They are given precedence, and no uncle, aunt, maternal uncle, or maternal aunt inherits alongside them. Just as the presence of a grandchild, even if distant, excludes siblings from inheriting, whether they are from the father, the mother, or both.",

		"englishText": "If the deceased leaves behind a paternal uncle, then all the wealth belongs to the paternal uncle. Likewise, if he leaves two paternal uncles, or three or more paternal uncles, the wealth is divided equally among them. If he leaves behind paternal uncles and paternal aunts, the entire wealth is divided among them with the male receiving the share of two females. If he leaves two paternal uncles, one being from both father and mother, and the other from the father only, the wealth belongs to the paternal uncle from both father and mother, and the paternal uncle from the father alone is excluded.\nIf he leaves a paternal uncle from both father and mother and a maternal uncle, then the maternal uncle receives one-sixth, and the remainder belongs to the paternal uncle from both father and mother. Similarly, if he leaves a paternal aunt and a maternal aunt, then the maternal aunt receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the paternal aunt.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle, all the wealth belongs to the maternal uncle. Similarly, if he leaves behind two or more maternal uncles, the wealth is divided equally among them. If he leaves maternal uncles and maternal aunts, the wealth is divided equally among them, with males and females receiving equal shares.\nIf he leaves two maternal uncles, one from both father and mother, and the other from the father only, the wealth goes to the maternal uncle from both father and mother, and the maternal uncle from the father alone is excluded. If he leaves two maternal uncles, one from the mother and the other from both father and mother, the maternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder belongs to the maternal uncle from both father and mother.\nSimilarly, if he leaves a maternal uncle from the father and a maternal uncle from the mother, the maternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the maternal uncle from the father. Likewise, if he leaves a maternal aunt from the mother and a maternal aunt from the father, the maternal aunt from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder belongs to the maternal aunt from the father.\nIf he leaves behind three separate maternal uncles and three separate paternal uncles, one-third of the wealth goes to the maternal uncles, with one-sixth of that third going to the maternal uncle from the mother and five-sixths going to the maternal uncle from both father and mother, and the maternal uncle from the father is excluded. Two-thirds of the wealth go to the paternal uncles, with one-sixth of those two-thirds going to the paternal uncle from the mother and five-sixths going to the paternal uncle from both father and mother, and the paternal uncle from the father is excluded. The calculation is based on thirty-six parts, with two parts for the maternal uncle from the mother, ten parts for the maternal uncle from both father and mother, four parts for the paternal uncle from the mother, and twenty parts for the paternal uncle from both father and mother.\nIf he leaves two maternal uncles from both father and mother and two maternal uncles from the mother, and two paternal uncles from both father and mother and two paternal uncles from the mother, then the two maternal uncles from the mother receive one-third of the third, amounting to four out of thirty-six, and the two maternal uncles from both father and mother receive two-thirds of the third, amounting to eight out of thirty-six. The two paternal uncles from the mother receive one-third of the two-thirds, amounting to eight out of thirty-six, and the two paternal uncles from both father and mother receive sixteen out of thirty-six.\nIf he leaves maternal uncles, maternal aunts, paternal uncles, and paternal aunts, then one-third of the wealth goes equally to the maternal uncles and maternal aunts, with males and females sharing equally, and two-thirds go to the paternal uncles and paternal aunts, with males receiving twice the share of females.\nIf he leaves a maternal uncle from the father and a paternal uncle from the mother, then one-third of the wealth goes to the maternal uncle from the father, and two-thirds go to the paternal uncle from the mother. If he leaves a maternal uncle from the mother and a paternal uncle from the father, then one-third goes to the maternal uncle from the mother because no one from the maternal side competes with him in inheritance, and two-thirds go to the paternal uncle from the father.\nIf he leaves a paternal uncle from the father and a cousin from both father and mother, then the wealth belongs to the cousin from both father and mother because he combines both paternal and maternal ties. This is not based on analogy but is confirmed by authentic narrations from the Imams (peace be upon them).\nIf he leaves two paternal cousins, one being a maternal brother, the wealth belongs to the maternal brother. If a woman leaves behind two paternal cousins, one being her husband, the husband receives half, and the remaining half is divided equally between the cousins.\nIf a man leaves behind a paternal cousin from both father and mother and a paternal cousin from the mother, then the paternal cousin from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the paternal cousin from both father and mother.\nIf he leaves a maternal uncle and a maternal grandmother, the wealth belongs to the maternal grandmother because she is closer in lineage.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle from his father and a maternal uncle from his mother, then all the wealth belongs to the maternal uncle from both his father and mother. Similarly, this ruling applies to the maternal aunt in this case and also applies to the paternal uncle and paternal aunt in this situation. The wealth goes to the one related from both the father and the mother and not to the one related only through the father.\nIf he leaves behind the daughter of a maternal uncle from both father and mother and the daughter of a maternal uncle from the mother, then the daughter of the maternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder belongs to the daughter of the maternal uncle from both the father and the mother.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle and the daughter of a maternal brother, the wealth belongs to the daughter of the maternal brother.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal aunt and the son of a maternal aunt, the wealth belongs to the maternal aunt because she is closer in lineage.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal aunt from his father and the son of his sister from his mother, the wealth belongs to the son of his sister from his mother.\nIf he leaves behind his maternal aunt, the daughter of his sister's daughter, and the son of his brother from his mother, the wealth belongs to the son of his brother from his mother.\nIf he leaves behind his maternal aunt, his brother's son, his brother's son's daughter, and his brother's son's granddaughter, the wealth belongs to his brother's son, and the rest are excluded.\nIf he leaves behind the son of his maternal aunt and the maternal uncle of his mother and the paternal uncle of his mother, the wealth belongs to the son of his maternal aunt.\nIf he leaves behind daughters of his maternal aunt and sons of his maternal aunt and his wife, then one-fourth of the wealth goes to the wife, and the remainder is divided equally between the sons and daughters of his maternal aunt.\nIf he leaves behind three separate maternal aunts, then the maternal aunt from his mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder belongs to the maternal aunt from both the father and the mother, while the maternal aunt from the father alone is excluded.\nIf he leaves behind three separate maternal uncles and three separate maternal aunts, then one-third of the wealth is divided equally between the maternal uncle and the maternal aunt from his mother, and the remainder goes to the maternal uncle and the maternal aunt from both the father and the mother, while the maternal uncle and the maternal aunt from the father alone are excluded.\nIf he leaves behind his maternal aunt and his maternal uncle from his mother, the wealth is divided equally between them.\nIf he leaves behind the daughter of his maternal uncle, the daughter of his maternal aunt, and his maternal aunt from his mother, the wealth is divided equally between the daughter of the maternal uncle and the daughter of the maternal aunt, and the maternal aunt from the mother is excluded.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal uncle, then all the wealth belongs to the paternal uncle. Similarly, if he leaves behind two or more paternal uncles, the wealth is divided equally among them.\nIf he leaves behind paternal uncles and paternal aunts, the wealth is divided among them with the male receiving the share of two females.\nIf he leaves behind two paternal uncles, one being from both his father and mother and the other from his father only, the wealth belongs to the paternal uncle from both his father and mother, and the paternal uncle from the father alone is excluded.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal uncle from both his father and mother and a paternal uncle from his mother, the paternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the paternal uncle from both his father and mother.\nSimilarly, if he leaves a paternal aunt from his mother and a paternal aunt from his father, the paternal aunt from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the paternal aunt from the father.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle, all the wealth belongs to the maternal uncle.\nSimilarly, if he leaves behind two or more maternal uncles, the wealth is divided equally among them.\nIf he leaves behind maternal uncles and maternal aunts, the wealth is divided equally among them, with males and females sharing equally.\nIf he leaves behind two maternal uncles, one from both his father and mother and the other from his father only, then the wealth belongs to the maternal uncle from both the father and the mother, and the maternal uncle from the father alone is excluded.\nIf he leaves behind two maternal uncles, one from his mother and the other from both his father and mother, then the maternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the maternal uncle from both his father and mother.\nSimilarly, if he leaves behind a maternal uncle from his father and a maternal uncle from his mother, the maternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the maternal uncle from the father.\nLikewise, if he leaves behind a maternal aunt from his mother and a maternal aunt from his father, the maternal aunt from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the maternal aunt from the father.\nIf he leaves behind three distinct maternal uncles and three distinct paternal uncles, then one-third of the wealth is divided between the two maternal uncles: one-sixth of the one-third for the maternal uncle from the mother, and five-sixths of the one-third for the maternal uncle from both the father and mother. The maternal uncle from the father alone is excluded.\nAs for the two paternal uncles, two-thirds of the wealth are divided: one-sixth of the two-thirds goes to the paternal uncle from the mother, and five-sixths of the two-thirds go to the paternal uncle from both the father and the mother. The paternal uncle from the father alone is excluded.\nThe division is based on thirty-six shares: the maternal uncle from the mother receives two shares, the maternal uncle from both the father and the mother receives ten shares, the paternal uncle from the mother receives four shares, and the paternal uncle from both the father and the mother receives twenty shares.\nIf he leaves behind two maternal uncles from both the father and the mother, two maternal uncles from the mother, two paternal uncles from both the father and the mother, and two paternal uncles from the mother, then the two maternal uncles from the mother receive one-third of the one-third, which is four shares from thirty-six. The two maternal uncles from both the father and mother receive two-thirds of the one-third, which is eight shares from thirty-six. The two paternal uncles from the mother receive one-third of the two-thirds, which is eight shares from thirty-six. The two paternal uncles from both the father and the mother receive sixteen shares from thirty-six.\nIf he leaves behind maternal uncles and maternal aunts, paternal uncles and paternal aunts, then one-third of the wealth goes to the maternal uncles and aunts equally, with males and females sharing alike, and two-thirds go to the paternal uncles and aunts, where the male gets the share of two females.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle from the father and a paternal uncle from the mother, the maternal uncle from the father gets one-third, and the paternal uncle from the mother gets two-thirds.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle from the mother and a paternal uncle from the father, then the maternal uncle from the mother gets one-third because no one from the mother's side shares the inheritance with him, and the paternal uncle from the father gets two-thirds.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal uncle from the father and a cousin from both the father and mother, the wealth belongs to the cousin from both the father and mother because he inherits through both paternal and maternal relations.\nIf he leaves behind two cousins, one being a maternal brother, the wealth belongs to the maternal brother.\nIf a woman leaves behind two cousins, one of whom is her husband, then the husband gets half, and the remaining half is divided equally between the two cousins.\nIf a man leaves behind a daughter of his paternal uncle from both the father and the mother and a daughter of his paternal uncle from the mother only, the daughter of the paternal uncle from the mother gets one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the daughter of the paternal uncle from both the father and the mother.\nSimilarly, if he leaves behind a daughter of his maternal uncle from both the father and the mother and a daughter of his maternal uncle from the mother, the daughter of the maternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the remainder goes to the daughter of the maternal uncle from both the father and the mother.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle and a maternal grandmother, the wealth belongs to the maternal grandmother, and the maternal uncle is excluded. Al-Fadl ibn Shadhan was mistaken in saying the wealth is divided equally between them, similar to the division between the paternal uncle and the grandfather.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal uncle and a nephew (son of his sister), the wealth belongs to the nephew.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal uncle and a nephew (son of his brother), the wealth belongs to the nephew.\nYunus ibn Abd Al-Rahman was mistaken in saying the wealth is divided equally between them. His confusion arose because he saw that both the paternal uncle and the nephew are equally related by three generations through the father. However, this is incorrect because although they are equal in generations, the nephew is from the descendants of the deceased's father, whereas the paternal uncle is from the descendants of the grandfather. Descendants of the father have a stronger claim than descendants of the grandfather.\nSimilarly, a grandson has a stronger claim than a brother because the grandson is from the deceased's own descendants, while the brother is from the father's descendants. Therefore, the deceased's descendants are more entitled to inheritance than the father's descendants, even if they are equal in generational distance.\nIf he leaves behind the daughter of his maternal aunt and the paternal aunt of his mother, the wealth belongs to the daughter of the maternal aunt because she is from the descendants of the maternal grandmother, whereas the paternal aunt of the mother is from the descendants of the grandmother of the mother. Descendants of the deceased's grandmother are more entitled to inheritance than those of the mother's grandmother.\nSimilarly, if he leaves behind the maternal uncle of his mother and his maternal cousin, the wealth belongs to the maternal cousin.\nIf he leaves behind the paternal aunt of his mother and the daughter of his maternal aunt, they are equal in generational distance, but the daughter of the maternal aunt is from the descendants of the deceased's grandmother, while the paternal aunt of the mother is from the descendants of the grandmother of the mother. Therefore, the daughter of the maternal aunt is more entitled to all the wealth, and the same applies to the maternal cousin.\nIf a woman leaves behind her husband, her paternal aunt, and her maternal aunt, the husband receives half, the maternal aunt receives one-third, and whatever remains goes to the paternal aunt. This is similar to the distribution when a woman leaves behind a husband and her parents: the husband receives half, the mother one-third, and the father one-sixth.\nIf a deceased person leaves behind a maternal uncle and a maternal aunt, the wealth is divided equally between them. Similarly, if he leaves behind a male cousin and a female cousin, the wealth is equally divided between them.\nIf he leaves behind the maternal aunt of his mother and the paternal aunt of his father, the maternal aunt of the mother receives one-third, and the paternal aunt of the father receives two-thirds.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle from his mother and a paternal uncle from his father, the maternal uncle from the mother receives one-third because there is no one else on the mother's side to share the inheritance with him, and the paternal uncle from the father receives two-thirds.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal uncle and a male cousin from both the father and the mother, the wealth goes to the cousin because he combines both paternal and maternal kinship. This ruling is based on a sound narration from the Imams, peace be upon them.\nIf he leaves behind two cousins, one of whom is also a maternal brother, the wealth belongs to the maternal brother.\nIf a woman leaves behind two cousins, one of whom is her husband, then the husband receives half, and the remaining half is divided equally between the two cousins.\nIf a man leaves behind a daughter of his paternal uncle from both the father and the mother and a daughter of his paternal uncle from the mother, the daughter of the paternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the rest goes to the daughter of the paternal uncle from both the father and the mother.\nSimilarly, if he leaves behind a daughter of his maternal uncle from both the father and the mother and a daughter of his maternal uncle from the mother, the daughter of the maternal uncle from the mother receives one-sixth, and the rest goes to the daughter of the maternal uncle from both the father and the mother.\nIf he leaves behind a maternal uncle and a maternal grandmother, the wealth belongs to the maternal grandmother, and the maternal uncle is excluded. Al-Fadl ibn Shadhan erred in his statement that the wealth should be divided equally between them, similar to the case of a paternal uncle and a grandfather.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal uncle and a nephew (son of his sister), the wealth belongs to the nephew.\nIf he leaves behind a paternal uncle and a nephew (son of his brother), the wealth belongs to the nephew.\nYunus ibn Abd Al-Rahman was mistaken in saying the wealth should be divided equally between them. His confusion stemmed from the fact that both the paternal uncle and the nephew are equally distant by three generations through the father. However, this is incorrect because, although they are equal in generational distance, the nephew descends from the deceased's father, whereas the paternal uncle descends from the grandfather. Descendants of the father have a stronger claim than descendants of the grandfather.\nSimilarly, a grandson has a stronger claim than a brother because the grandson descends from the deceased, while the brother descends from the father. Therefore, the descendants of the deceased have a stronger right to inheritance than the father's descendants, even if they are equally distant in generations.\nIf he leaves behind the daughter of his maternal aunt and the paternal aunt of his mother, the wealth belongs to the daughter of the maternal aunt because she is from the descendants of the maternal grandmother, while the paternal aunt of the mother is from the descendants of the grandmother of the mother. Therefore, the descendants of the deceased's grandmother have a stronger claim than those of the mother's grandmother.\nSimilarly, if he leaves behind the maternal uncle of his mother and his maternal cousin, the wealth belongs to the maternal cousin.\nIf he leaves behind the paternal aunt of his mother and the daughter of his maternal aunt, they are equal in generational distance. However, the paternal aunt of the mother is from the descendants of the mother's grandmother, whereas the daughter of the maternal aunt is from the descendants of the deceased's grandmother. Therefore, the daughter of the maternal aunt has a stronger claim to the entire inheritance.\nLikewise, the same ruling applies to a maternal cousin.\nIf a woman leaves behind her husband, her paternal aunt, and her maternal aunt, the husband receives half, the maternal aunt receives one-third, and whatever remains goes to the paternal aunt.

However, if he leaves behind multiple benefactors or those upon whom favors were bestowed, both men and women, the wealth is to be divided among them, with the male receiving the share equal to that of two females.\nIf he leaves behind the sons and daughters of his benefactor or the one upon whom he bestowed favors, and there is no other heir, the wealth belongs to the sons and daughters of his benefactor, with the male receiving the share equal to that of two females. This is because the bond of loyalty (wala') is like the bond of kinship.\nHowever, if he leaves behind an heir from his blood relatives, whether closely or distantly related, along with his benefactor or the one upon whom he bestowed favors, the wealth belongs to the blood relative, and the benefactor receives nothing.\nThis is because Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, says:\n\"Those who are related by blood are more entitled to inherit from each other in the Book of Allah (swt) than the believers and the emigrants, except that you do kindness to your allies,\"\n(Surah Al-Ahzab 33:6),\nThis meaning through a will for them or by the heirs gifting them something from the inheritance.",

However, a woman is not required to support a man, nor is she responsible for his expenses if he is in need. Therefore, more has been allocated to the man for this reason. This is in accordance with the saying of Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic:\n'Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allah (swt) has given one more (strength) than the other and because they spend from their wealth.'\" (Surah An-Nisa 4:34).",

		"englishText": "(Prophet (sw) continued); \" O' Ali (as), every intoxicant is forbidden, and whatever intoxicates in large quantities, then even a sip of it is forbidden.\nO' Ali (as), all sins have been placed in a house, and their key is alcohol consumption.\nO' Ali (as), there comes a time upon the drinker of alcohol when he does not recognize his Lord (azj), the Almighty and Glorious.\nO' Ali (as), the removal of mighty mountains is easier than the removal of a kingdom whose appointed term has not yet ended.\nO' Ali (as), whoever does not benefit you in your religion and your worldly life, there is no good for you in his companionship, and whoever does not regard you, do not regard him, and there is no honor for him.\nO' Ali (as), a believer should have eight qualities: dignity in times of turmoil, patience in affliction, gratitude in ease, contentment with what Allah (swt), the Almighty and Glorious, has provided him, not oppressing enemies, not burdening friends, his body is in toil while people are at ease from him.\nO' Ali (as), there are four whose supplications are never rejected: a just leader, a father for his child, a person who prays for his brother in his absence, and the oppressed. Allah (swt), the Almighty and Glorious, says, 'By My might and majesty, I shall surely grant you victory, even after some time.'\"\nO' Ali (as), there are eight types of people who, if they are humiliated, should blame no one but themselves: the one who goes to a feast to which he was not invited, the one who interferes in the affairs of the master of the house, the one who seeks goodness from his enemies, the one who asks for favor from the miserly, the one who interferes in a secret matter between two people without being involved, the one who disrespects authority, the one who sits in a gathering where he does not belong, and the one who speaks to someone who does not listen to him.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt) has forbidden Paradise to every obscene and foul-mouthed person who does not care what he says or what is said to him.\nO' Ali (as), blessed is the one whose life is long and his deeds are good.\nO' Ali (as), do not joke too much, for it will take away your dignity, and do not lie, for it will take away your light.\nBeware of two traits: impatience and laziness. If you are impatient, you will not endure the truth, and if you are lazy, you will not fulfill your duties.\nO' Ali (as), every sin has a repentance except bad character, for its possessor, whenever he leaves one sin, enters into another.\nO' Ali (as), four types of people receive punishment the fastest: a man to whom you have done good, but he repays your kindness with evil; a man against whom you bear no ill will, but he bears ill will against you; a man with whom you made an agreement, and you fulfilled it, but he betrayed you; and a man who maintains ties of kinship, but they cut him off.\nO' Ali (as), whoever is overwhelmed by impatience, comfort departs from him.\nO' Ali (as), there are twelve qualities that a Muslim man should learn regarding dining: four of them are obligatory, four are recommended practices, and four are etiquettes.\nAs for the obligatory ones, they are: knowing what one eats, saying the name of Allah (swt), expressing gratitude, and being content.\nThe recommended practices are: sitting on the left leg, eating with three fingers, eating from what is in front of him, and licking the fingers.\nThe etiquettes are: taking small bites, chewing thoroughly, avoiding looking at people's faces while eating, and washing the hands.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Almighty and Glorious, created Paradise from two bricks: one of gold and one of silver, and made its walls of ruby, its roof of emerald, its pebbles of pearls, and its soil of saffron and fragrant musk. Then He (swt) said to it, \"Speak!\" and it said, There is no God but Allah (swt), the Ever-Living, the Sustainer. Blessed is the one who enters me. Allah (swt), the Glorious and Majestic, said: \"By My Might and My Glory, none shall enter it who is addicted to alcohol, nor the slanderer, nor the cuckold, nor the oppressor, nor the effeminate, nor the grave robber, nor the tax collector, nor the one who severs ties of kinship, nor the Qadari (who denies divine predestination).\"\nO' Ali (as), ten people from this nation have disbelieved in Allah (swt), the Almighty: the tale-bearer, the sorcerer, the cuckold, the one who engages in unlawful intercourse with a woman in her rectum, the one who has intercourse with an animal, the one who marries a woman who is forbidden to him, the one who incites discord, the one who sells weapons to the enemies in war, the one who withholds zakat, and the one who finds financial means but dies without performing Hajj.\nO' Ali (as), there should be no feast except in five cases: during a wedding, at the birth of a child, upon circumcision, when building or purchasing a house, and upon returning from a journey. The wedding feast is for marriage, the birth feast is for celebrating the birth of a child, the circumcision feast is for the ritual circumcision, the feast for building or buying a house is known as Wikar, and the feast upon returning from a journey is known as Rikaz.",

		"englishText": "(Prophet (sw) continued); O' Ali (as), it is not appropriate for an intelligent person to travel except for three reasons: to seek provision for his livelihood, to gather provisions for the Hereafter, or to enjoy a permissible pleasure.\nO' Ali (as), there are three noble traits in both this world and the Hereafter: to forgive those who wrong you, to maintain ties with those who cut you off, and to show patience with those who act ignorantly towards you.\nO' Ali (as), hasten to accomplish four things before four: your youth before your old age, your health before your illness, your wealth before your poverty, and your life before your death.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Almighty, dislikes for my nation certain things: fidgeting during prayer, boasting about charity, entering mosques while in a state of impurity, laughing in graveyards, peeking into people's homes, and looking at the private parts of women, for it leads to blindness.\nAllah (swt) also dislikes speaking during intimacy as it leads to muteness, sleeping between the Maghrib and Isha prayers as it deprives one of sustenance, bathing under the open sky without a covering, entering rivers without a covering because they contain angels, entering bathhouses without a covering, speaking between the call to prayer (Adhan) and the Iqama in the Fajr prayer, sailing the sea when it is turbulent, and sleeping on a roof without a protective barrier.\nProphet (sw) said: \"Whoever sleeps on a roof without a protective barrier has absolved himself of responsibility.\"\nProphet (sw) disliked a person sleeping alone in a house, and He (sw) disliked a man having relations with his wife while she is menstruating. If he does so and the child is born with leprosy or vitiligo, he should blame none but himself.\nProphet (sw) also disliked a man speaking to a person afflicted with leprosy unless there is a distance of at least an arm's length between them.\"\nProphet (sw) said: \"Flee from a leper as you would flee from a lion.\"\nProphet (sw) disliked a man approaching his wife after having a nocturnal emission until he has performed the ritual purification. If he does so and the child is born mentally impaired, he should blame none but himself.\nProphet (sw) disliked urinating on the bank of a flowing river, and he disliked relieving oneself under a fruit-bearing tree or palm tree.\nProphet (sw) disliked relieving oneself while standing, putting on shoes while standing, and entering a dark house without a lamp.\nO' Ali (as), the affliction of noble lineage is arrogance.\nO' Ali (as), whoever fears Allah (swt), everything will fear him, and whoever does not fear Allah (swt), Allah (swt) will make him fearful of everything.\nO' Ali (as), there are eight types of people whose prayers Allah (swt) does not accept: the runaway slave until he returns to his master, the rebellious wife whose husband is displeased with her, the one who withholds zakat, the one who neglects ablution, the mature girl who prays without a head covering, an imam who leads a congregation that dislikes him, the intoxicated person, and the one who prays while suppressing the urge to urinate or defecate.\nO' Ali (as), there are four qualities for which Allah (swt) builds a house in Paradise for the one who possesses them: one who shelters the orphan, has mercy on the weak, is compassionate toward his parents, and treats his servant with kindness.\nO' Ali (as), there are three things that if a person meets Allah (swt) with them, he will be among the best of people: whoever fulfills what Allah (swt) has made obligatory upon him, he will be among the most devoted worshippers; whoever abstains from what Allah (swt) has prohibited, he will be among the most pious; and whoever is content with what Allah (swt) has provided for him, he will be among the richest of people.\nO' Ali (as), there are three things that this nation cannot bear: sharing one's wealth with his brother, treating people with fairness from oneself, and remembering Allah (swt) in all circumstances. And this remembrance is not merely saying \"Subhanallah (swt), Alhamdulillah, La ilaha illa Allah (swt), Allahu Akbar,\" but it is when one faces something prohibited and fears Allah (swt) and refrains from it.\nO' Ali (as), there are three types of people who will wrong you if you treat them with fairness: the lowly, your family, and your servant. And three types of people will never be treated fairly by three others: a free man by a slave, a learned man by an ignorant person, and a strong person by a weak one.\nO' Ali (as), seven qualities, if found in a person, complete his faith, and the gates of Paradise are opened for him: one who perfects his ablution, performs his prayer properly, pays the zakat of his wealth, restrains his anger, controls his tongue, seeks forgiveness for his sins, and gives sincere advice to the family of his Prophet.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt) has cursed three types of people: one who eats alone, one who travels alone in the wilderness, and one who sleeps alone in a house.\nO' Ali (as), three things are feared to cause madness: relieving oneself between graves, walking with only one shoe, and sleeping alone.\nO' Ali (as), there are three situations where lying is permissible: strategizing in war, making a promise to your wife, and reconciling between people.\nO' Ali (as), three things kill the heart: sitting with the lowly, associating with the wealthy, and engaging in idle talk with women.\nO' Ali (as), three things are among the realities of faith: spending in times of hardship, treating people with fairness, and sharing knowledge with those who seek it.\nO' Ali (as), three things, if a person does not possess them, his deeds will not be complete: a piety that prevents him from disobeying Allah (swt), good character to interact with people, and patience to withstand the ignorance of the ignorant.\nO' Ali (as), there are three joys for a believer in this world: meeting his brothers in faith, breaking the fast of a fasting person, and engaging in prayer in the last part of the night.\nO' Ali (as), I warn you against three traits: envy, greed, and arrogance.\nO' Ali (as), four traits are signs of misery: dryness of the eyes (lack of tears), hardness of the heart, long aspirations, and love for staying in this world.\nO' Ali (as), there are three levels, three expiations, three destructive qualities, and three saving virtues. As for the levels, they are: performing ablution thoroughly in hardship, waiting for the next prayer after finishing one, and walking to congregational prayers day and night.\nAs for the expiations, they are: spreading peace, feeding others, and praying at night while people are asleep.\nAs for the destructive qualities, they are: obeying greed, following desires, and self-admiration.\nAnd as for the saving virtues, they are: fearing Allah (swt) in secret and in public, moderation in wealth and poverty, and speaking words of justice in times of pleasure and displeasure.\nO' Ali (as), there is no nursing after weaning, and no orphanhood after reaching maturity.\nO' Ali (as), travel for two years to be dutiful to your parents, travel for one year to maintain ties of kinship, travel for a mile to visit the sick, travel for two miles to follow a funeral procession, travel for three miles to accept an invitation, travel for four miles to visit a brother in faith, travel for five miles to help someone in distress, and travel for six miles to support the oppressed. And always engage in seeking forgiveness.\nO' Ali (as), a believer has three signs: prayer, almsgiving, and fasting.\nA pretentious person has three signs: he flatters when present, backbites when absent, and rejoices over people's misfortunes.\nA tyrant has three signs: he oppresses those beneath him with force, disobeys those above him, and sides with other oppressors.\nA hypocrite has three signs: he lies when he speaks, breaks his promises, and betrays when entrusted.\nO' Ali (as), nine things cause forgetfulness: eating sour apples, eating coriander, eating cheese, drinking the leftover of a mouse, reading inscriptions on graves, walking between two women, throwing lice away, cupping at the crown of the head, and urinating in stagnant water.\nO' Ali (as), the essence of a good life lies in three things: a spacious home, a beautiful spouse, and a well-bred horse.",

		"englishText": "(Prophet (sw) continued); O' Ali (as), the believer is the one whom Muslims trust with their wealth and lives, and the Muslim is the one from whose hand and tongue other Muslims are safe, and the emigrant is the one who abandons sins.\nO' Ali (as), the strongest bond of faith is love for the sake of Allah (swt) and hatred for the sake of Allah (swt).\nO' Ali (as), whoever obeys his wife in matters that lead to disobedience, Allah (swt), the Almighty and Majestic, will throw him on his face into the fire.\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said: \"What kind of obedience is that?\"\nThe Prophet (sw) replied: \"Allowing her to go to public baths, weddings, mourning gatherings, and to wear revealing clothing.\"\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, has abolished the arrogance and pride of pre-Islamic ignorance and its boasting about ancestors. Verily, people are from Adam, and Adam is from dust. The most honorable of them in the sight of Allah (swt) is the most pious.\nO' Ali (as), unlawful earnings include the price of a dead animal, the price of a dog, the price of alcohol, the dowry of a prostitute, a bribe in judgment, and the fee of a soothsayer.\nO' Ali (as), whoever seeks knowledge to argue with the foolish, to debate with scholars, or to draw people to himself, he is among the people of Hellfire.\nO' Ali (as), when a person dies, people ask, \"What has he left behind?\" while the angels ask, \"What has he sent ahead?\"\nO' Ali (as), this world is a prison for the believer and a paradise for the disbeliever.\nO' Ali (as), sudden death is a relief for the believer and a regret for the disbeliever.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, revealed to the world: \"Serve those who serve Me, and exhaust those who serve you.\"\nO' Ali (as), if this world were worth the wing of a mosquito in the sight of Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, He (swt) would not have given the disbeliever even a sip of water from it.\nO' Ali (as), every person from the first to the last will wish on the Day of Judgment that they had received from this world only enough to sustain them.\nO' Ali (as), the worst of people is the one who doubts Allah's (swt) decree.\nO' Ali (as), the groaning of the believer is glorification, his shouting is the declaration of God's oneness, his sleep on his bed is worship, and his turning from side to side is striving in the way of Allah (swt). If he recovers, he walks among the people without a sin upon him.\nO' Ali (as), if I were given a leg of meat as a gift, I would accept it, and if I were invited to partake of a leg of meat, I would respond.\nO' Ali (as), women are not required to attend the Friday prayer, congregational prayers, call to prayer, Iqama, visiting the sick, following funeral processions, running between Safa and Marwa, touching the Black Stone, shaving the head, taking up judicial positions, being consulted, slaughtering animals except in necessity, raising their voices in the Talbiyah, standing by graves, listening to sermons, arranging their own marriages, or leaving their husband's house without his permission. If she leaves without his permission, Allah (swt), Jibril, and Mikaeel will curse her. She should not give away anything from her husband's house without his consent, nor should she sleep while he is displeased with her, even if he is unjust to her.\nO' Ali (as), Islam is naked; its clothing is modesty, its adornment is loyalty, its dignity is righteous deeds, and its foundation is piety. Everything has a foundation, and the foundation of Islam is love for us, the Ahlulbayt (as).\nO' Ali (as), bad character is an ill omen, and obeying a woman leads to regret.\nO' Ali (as), if there is ill fortune in anything, it is in the tongue of a woman.\nO' Ali (as), those who carry little burden are saved.\nO' Ali (as), whoever deliberately lies about me, let him prepare his seat in the Fire.\nO' Ali (as), three things increase memory and remove phlegm: chewing frankincense, using the miswak, and reciting the Quran.\nO' Ali (as), the miswak is part of the Sunnah; it purifies the mouth, enhances eyesight, pleases the Most Merciful, whitens the teeth, removes tartar, strengthens the gums, increases appetite, eliminates phlegm, boosts memory, multiplies good deeds, and brings joy to the angels.\nO' Ali (as), sleep is of four types: the sleep of the prophets, peace be upon them, is on their backs; the sleep of the believers is on their right sides; the sleep of the disbelievers and hypocrites is on their left sides; and the sleep of the devils is on their faces.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Almighty and Exalted, did not send any prophet except that He (swt) made his progeny from his own loins, but He (swt) made my progeny from your loins. If it were not for you (as), I (sw) would have had no descendants.\nO' Ali (as), four things break a person's back: a leader who disobeys Allah (swt), yet his orders are followed; a wife who is protected by her husband yet betrays him; poverty that leaves a person without treatment; and a bad neighbour in a permanent residence.\nO' Ali (as), indeed Abdul Muttalib (as), peace be upon him, established five practices during the era of ignorance (Jahiliyyah), which Allah (swt), the Almighty, continued in Islam.\nHe prohibited the wives of fathers for their sons, and Allah (swt), the Almighty, revealed: \"And do not marry women whom your fathers married.\"\nHe discovered a treasure and took out a fifth of it and gave it in charity, and Allah (swt), the Almighty, revealed: \"And know that whatever you obtain of war booty - then indeed, for Allah (swt) is one-fifth of it and for the Messenger...\"\nWhen he dug the well of Zamzam, he named it the provision for the pilgrims, and Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, revealed: \"Have you made the providing of water for the pilgrim and the maintenance of Al-Masjid Al-Haram equal to [the deeds of] the one who believes in Allah (swt) and the Last Day?\"\nO' Ali (as), Abdul Muttalib established the practice of a hundred camels as blood money for killing, and Allah (swt), the Almighty, continued this practice in Islam.\nThere was no fixed number for circumambulation (Tawaf) among the Quraysh, but Abdul Muttalib prescribed seven circuits for them, and Allah (swt), the Almighty, continued this practice in Islam.\nO' Ali (as), Abdul Muttalib never practiced divination by arrows, nor did he worship idols, nor eat anything slaughtered on stone altars, and he used to say: \"I am on the religion of my father Ibrahim, peace be upon him.\"\nO' Ali (as), the most astonishing people in faith and the greatest in certainty will be those who live in the end times; they will not have met the Prophet (sw) nor seen the proof, yet they will believe based on black lines on white paper.\nO' Ali (as), three things harden the heart: listening to idle talk, excessive hunting, and approaching the doors of rulers.\nO' Ali (as), do not pray in the skin of animals whose milk you do not drink and whose meat you do not eat. Do not pray in places known as Dhat Al-Jaysh, Dhat Al-Salasil, or Dhajnan.\nO' Ali (as), eat from eggs that have different ends, from fish that have scales, and from birds that flap their wings when they fly; avoid those that glide. Eat from water birds that have a crop or spurs.\nO' Ali (as), every predatory animal with fangs and every bird with talons is forbidden to eat; do not consume them.\nO' Ali (as), there is no punishment for stealing fruit or palm shoots.\nO' Ali (as), there is no blood money for a fornicator, no punishment for insinuation, no intercession in prescribed punishments, and no oath in severing family ties. A child cannot take an oath against their parent, nor can a wife against her husband, nor a servant against his master. There is no fasting from morning until night, no continuous fasting, and no reverting to a life of ignorance after migration.\nO' Ali (as), a parent is not to be executed for killing their child.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt) does not accept the supplication of a heedless heart.\nO' Ali (as), the sleep of a scholar is better than the worship of a devoted worshiper.\nO' Ali (as), two units of prayer offered by a scholar are better than a thousand units offered by a worshiper.\nO' Ali (as), a woman should not observe voluntary fasting without her husband's permission, nor should a servant without their master's permission, nor should a guest without the host's permission.\nO' Ali (as), fasting on the day of Eid Al-Fitr is forbidden, fasting on the day of Eid Al-Adha is forbidden, continuous fasting is forbidden, silence fasting is forbidden, fasting as a vow for sin is forbidden, and perpetual fasting is forbidden.\nO' Ali (as), there are six consequences of fornication: three in this world and three in the Hereafter. As for those in this world, it takes away dignity, hastens death, and cuts off sustenance. As for those in the Hereafter, they result in a difficult reckoning, the wrath of the Merciful, and eternal punishment in the Fire.\nO' Ali (as), usury consists of seventy parts, the least of which is like a man committing fornication with his mother in the sacred House of Allah (swt).\nO' Ali (as), one dirham gained through usury is greater in sin before Allah (swt) than seventy acts of fornication, all with a forbidden relative, in the sacred House of Allah (swt).\nO' Ali (as), whoever withholds even a small portion of the zakat due on his wealth is neither a believer nor a Muslim, and he has no honor.\nO' Ali (as), the one who neglects zakat will plead to Allah (swt) for a return to the world, as Allah (swt) the Almighty says: \"Until, when death comes to one of them, he says, My Lord (azj), send me back.'\"\nO' Ali (as), whoever is capable of performing Hajj and does not do so is considered a disbeliever, as Allah (swt) the Exalted says: \"And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah (swt) for mankind, for him who can find a way there. And whoever disbelieves, then verily Allah (swt) is Independent of all creation.\"\nO' Ali (as), whoever postpones Hajj until he dies, Allah (swt) will resurrect him on the Day of Judgment as a Jew or a Christian.\nO' Ali (as), charity repels decrees that have been firmly established.\nO' Ali (as), maintaining ties of kinship increases lifespan.\nO' Ali (as), begin your meals with salt and end with salt, for it is a cure for seventy-two diseases.\nO' Ali (as), if I were to stand at the Praised Station (maqam Al Mahmoud), I would intercede for my father (as), my mother {s.a}, my uncle (as), and a brother (as) I had in the pre-Islamic era.\nO' Ali (as), I am the son of the two sacrifices.\nO' Ali (as), I am the answer to the supplication of my father Ibrahim.\nO' Ali (as), intellect is that by which Paradise is attained and the pleasure of the Most Merciful is sought.\nO' Ali (as), the first creation that Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, created was the intellect. He (swt) said to it, \"Come forward,\" and it came forward. Then He (swt) said: \"Go back,\" and it went back. Then He (swt) said: \"By My might and majesty, I have not created a creation more beloved to Me (swt) than you; by you I take, by you I give, by you I reward, and by you I punish.\"\nO' Ali (as), there is no charity when a relative is in need.\nO' Ali (as), a dirham spent on dyeing hair is better than a thousand dirhams spent in the way of Allah (swt), for it contains fourteen benefits: it repels wind from the ears, enhances eyesight, softens the nostrils, sweetens the breath, strengthens the gums, removes weakness, reduces the whispering of Satan, delights the angels, gladdens the believer, angers the disbeliever, serves as an adornment and fragrance, causes Munkar and Nakir to feel shy of him, and it serves as a means of absolution in his grave.\nO' Ali (as), there is no good in speech without action, nor in appearance without substance, nor in wealth without generosity, nor in truth without loyalty, nor in jurisprudence without piety, nor in charity without intention, nor in life without health, nor in homeland without security and happiness.\nO' Ali (as), seven things are forbidden from the sheep: blood, male reproductive organs, the bladder, the spinal cord, the glands, the spleen, and the gall bladder.\nO' Ali (as), do not bargain in four things: the purchase of a sacrificial animal, a shroud, the freeing of a slave, and the fare for traveling to Mecca.\nO' Ali (as), shall I not inform you of the one who resembles me the most in character?\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said: \"Yes, O' Messenger of Allah (swt).\"\nThe Prophet (sw) said: \"The one with the best character among you, the one with the greatest patience, the one who is most kind to his relatives, and the one who is most fair in dealing with others.\"\nO' Ali (as), protection for my nation from drowning when they board ships is to recite: In the name of Allah (swt), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and They did not appreciate Allah (swt) with the appreciation due to Him; and the entire earth will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand. Glorified is He and high above what they associate with Him, and In the name of Allah (swt) shall be its course and its anchorage; surely my Lord (azj) is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful. (Surah Az-Zumar 39:67)\nO' Ali (as), protection for my nation from theft is to recite: Say: Call upon Allah (swt), or call upon the Most Gracious; by whatever name you call upon Him, to Him belong the most beautiful names. (Surah Al Isra 17:110)\nO' Ali (as), protection for my nation from destruction is in reciting: Indeed, Allah (swt) holds the heavens and the earth lest they move, and if they should move, no one could hold them after Him; indeed, He is Ever Forbearing, Ever Forgiving. (Surah Fatir 35:41)\nO' Ali (as), protection for my nation from distress is in saying: There is no power and no strength except with Allah (swt), the Most High, the Most Great. And 'There is no refuge and no escape from Allah (swt) except to Him'. (Surah At-Tawbah 9:118)\nO' Ali (as), protection for my nation from fire is in reciting: Indeed, my protector is Allah (swt), who has sent down the Book, and He takes care of the righteous, and They did not appreciate Allah (swt) with the appreciation due to Him... (Surah Al-A'raf 7:196)\nO' Ali (as), whoever fears wild beasts should recite: Certainly, a Messenger has come to you from among yourselves; it grieves him that you should perish... until the end of the chapter. (Surah At-Tawbah 9:128)\nO' Ali (as), whoever finds difficulty with his mount should recite in its right ear: And to Him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they shall be returned. (Surah AAl-e-Imran 3:83)\nO' Ali (as), whoever suffers from Abdominal dropsy should write Ayat Al-Kursi on his stomach and drink it, for he shall be cured by the permission of Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic.\nO' Ali (as), whoever fears a sorcerer or a devil should recite: Indeed, your Lord (azj) is Allah (swt), who created the heavens and the earth... (Surah Al-A'raf 7:54)\nO' Ali (as), the right of the child upon his father is that he gives him a good name, teaches him good manners, and places him in a righteous environment. The right of the father upon his child is that he should not call him by his name, should not walk ahead of him, should not sit before him, and should not enter the bathhouse with him.\nO' Ali (as), three things are from whispers of Shaytan: eating clay, biting nails with teeth, and consuming one's beard.\nO' Ali (as), may Allah (swt) curse parents who lead their child to disobey them.\nO' Ali (as), parents are responsible for the disobedience of their children in the same way that children are responsible for disobeying their parents.\nO' Ali (as), may Allah (swt) have mercy on parents who encourage their children to be righteous to them.\nO' Ali (as), whoever saddens his parents has indeed disobeyed them.\nO' Ali (as), whoever hears his Muslim brother being backbitten and has the ability to defend him but does not, Allah (swt) will forsake him in this world and the Hereafter.\nO' Ali (as), whoever provides for an orphan with his wealth until the orphan becomes self-sufficient, Paradise is assured for him without doubt.\nO' Ali (as), whoever passes his hand over an orphan's head out of compassion, Allah (swt) will grant him a light for every hair he touched on the Day of Judgment.\nO' Ali (as), there is no poverty worse than ignorance, no wealth more beneficial than intelligence, no loneliness worse than arrogance, no intellect like planning, no piety like refraining from what Allah (swt) has forbidden, no nobility like good character, and no worship like contemplation.\nO' Ali (as), the flaw of speech is lying, the flaw of knowledge is forgetfulness, the flaw of worship is laziness, the flaw of beauty is arrogance, and the flaw of knowledge is envy.\nO' Ali (as), four things are wasted in vain: eating when already full, lighting a lamp under the moonlight, planting crops in barren land, and doing a favor for those who are unworthy of it.\nO' Ali (as), whoever forgets to send blessings upon me has indeed lost the path to Paradise.\nO' Ali (as), beware of the pecking of the crow and the swooping of the lion.\nO' Ali (as), placing my hand inside the mouth of a dragon up to my elbow is more beloved to me than asking from someone who was nothing and then became something.\nO' Ali (as), the most rebellious people against Allah (swt), the Almighty, are those who kill someone other than their killer, strike someone other than their attacker, and those who align themselves with other than their rightful leaders; such a person has indeed disbelieved in what Allah (swt) has revealed to me.\nO' Ali (as), wear the ring on your right hand, for it is a virtue from Allah (swt), the Almighty, for those who are close to Him.\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) asked: \"With what should I wear the ring, O' Messenger of Allah (swt)?\"\nProphet (sw) said: O' Ali (as), wear a ring of red agate, for it was the first mountain to acknowledge Allah's (swt) Lordship (azj), my Prophethood, your successorship, the Imamate of your progeny, Paradise for your followers, and Hellfire for your enemies.\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Almighty, looked upon the people of the world and chose Me (sw) from among them over the men of the worlds. Then, He (swt) looked a second time and chose you (as) over the men of the worlds. Then, He (swt) looked a third time and chose the Imams (as) from your (as) progeny over the men of the worlds. Then, He (swt) looked a fourth time and chose (Sayyida) Fatimah {s.a} over the women of the worlds.\nO' Ali (as), I have seen your name paired with mine in three places, and I was comforted by seeing it. When I reached Bayt Al-Maqdis during my ascension to the heavens, I found inscribed on its rock: 'There is no God but Allah (swt), Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (swt). I (swt) have supported Him (sw) with his minister and granted Him (sw) victory through his minister.'\nI (Prophet (sw)) asked Jibril (as): \"Who is my minister?\"\nJibril (as) replied: \"(Imam) Ali ibn Abi Talib (as).\"\n(Prophet (sw) continued); Then, when I reached the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary (Sidrat Al-Muntaha), I found written upon it:\n'Indeed, I am Allah (swt); there is no God but Me (swt) alone. Muhammad (sw) is My (swt) chosen one from My creation; I (swt) have supported Him (sw) with his minister and granted him victory through his minister (Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as)).\nO' Ali (as), when I passed beyond the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary, I reached the Throne of the Lord (azj) of the Worlds, Glorified and Exalted is He (swt), and I found written on its pillars:\n'Indeed, I am Allah (swt); there is no God but Me (swt) alone. Muhammad (sw) is My (swt) beloved; and I (swt) have supported him with his minister (Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as)) and granted him victory through his minister (Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as)).\nO' Ali (as), Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted, has granted me seven qualities concerning you.\nYou (as) will be the first to rise from your grave with me (sw).\nYou (as) will be the first to stand with Me (sw) on the Sirat (bridge over Hell).\nYou (as) will be the first to be clothed when I (sw) am clothed (On Day of Resurrection).\nYou (as) will live where I (sw) live.\nYou (as) will be the first to dwell with Me (sw) in the highest ranks of Paradise.\nYou (as) will be the first to drink with Me (sw) from the sealed nectar, its seal is musk.\nThen the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said to Salman Al-Farsi, may Allah (swt) have mercy on him:\n\"O' Salman, when you fall ill, you are given three blessings: you are in remembrance of Allah (swt), the Blessed and Exalted; your supplication during illness is answered; and your illness does not leave any sin upon you except that it is erased. May Allah (swt) grant you well-being until the end of your appointed term.\"\nThen the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said to Abu Dharr, may Allah (swt) have mercy on him:\n\"O' Abu Dharr, beware of asking from others, for it is an immediate humiliation and hastened poverty, and it brings a lengthy reckoning on the Day of Judgment. O' Abu Dharr, you shall live alone, die alone, and enter Paradise alone. A group of people from Iraq will take care of your washing, shrouding, and burial, and they will be blessed by it.\nO' Abu Dharr, do not ask with your hand, but if something comes to you, accept it.\"\nThen the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said to his companions:\n\"Shall I not inform you of the worst among you?\"\nThey said: \"Indeed, O' Messenger of Allah (swt).\"\nProphet (sw) said: \"Those who walk around spreading gossip, those who create division between loved ones, and those who seek faults in the innocent.\"",

I am an old man who has heard countless virtues about you, and I believe that you may be assassinated. Teach me from what Allah (swt) has taught you.\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said: \"Yes, O' elderly man;\n'Whoever's two days are equal is at a loss.'\n'Whoever makes this world his main concern will suffer greatly at its departure.'\n'Whoever's tomorrow is worse than his today is deprived.'\n'Whoever does not care about what he loses from his Hereafter as long as his worldly affairs are intact is destroyed.'\n'Whoever does not regularly examine his own shortcomings will be overtaken by his desires.'\nAnd 'whoever is in a state of deficiency, death is better for him.'\nO' elderly man, be pleased for people with what you are pleased for yourself and treat people as you would like to be treated.\"\nThen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) turned to his companions and said:\n\"O' people, do you not see how the people of this world end their evenings and begin their mornings in various conditions?\nAmong them is one who is writhing in pain, another visiting and being visited, another struggling with his soul, another who has no hope left, another who is shrouded, one who seeks the world while death is seeking him, one who is heedless yet is not forgotten, and the remaining are following in the footsteps of those who have passed.\"\nZayd ibn Suhan Al-Abdi then asked: \"O' Commander of the Faithful (as), which power is the most dominant and strongest?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Desire.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which humiliation is the most degrading?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Greed for the world.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which poverty is the most severe?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Disbelief after faith.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which call is the most misguided?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who calls for what cannot be.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which deed is the best?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Piety.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which action is the most successful?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Seeking what is with Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who is the worst companion for you?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who beautifies disobedience to Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, for you.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among creation is the most wretched?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who sells his religion for the worldly life of another.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among creation is the strongest?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who is patient and forbearing.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among creation is the most miserly?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who acquires wealth unlawfully and spends it inappropriately.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among people is the wisest?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who recognizes his guidance from his misguidance and inclines towards his guidance.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among people is the most patient?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who does not become angry.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among people has the most steadfast opinion?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who is not deceived by people about himself and whom the world does not deceive with its attractions.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among people is the most foolish?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who is deluded by the world despite witnessing its changing conditions.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among people will have the greatest regret?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who is deprived of both this world and the Hereafter - that is the clear loss.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among creation is the most blind?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who acts for other than Allah (swt) while seeking reward for his actions from Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which contentment is the best?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Being content with what Allah (swt), the Majestic, has given.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which affliction is the most severe?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The affliction in religion.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which deeds are most beloved to Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Awaiting relief (deliverance).\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among people is the best in the sight of Allah (swt)?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who fears Allah (swt) the most, acts most righteously with piety, and is the most detached from the world.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which speech is the best in the sight of Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Abundant remembrance of Him (swt) and humbly supplicating to Him (swt) in prayer.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which statement is the most truthful?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The testimony that there is 'no God but Allah (swt)'.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Which deeds are the greatest before Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"Submission (to Allah (swt)) and piety.\"\nHe (Zayd) asked: \"Who among people is the most truthful?\"\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) replied: \"The one who is truthful in all circumstances.\"\nThen the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, turned to the elderly man and said:\n\"O' elderly man, indeed Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic, has created people upon whom He (swt) has narrowed the worldly life, looking upon them with care.\nHe (swt) made them disinterested in it and in its fleeting pleasures, so they longed for the Abode of Peace (Paradise) to which He (swt) invited them. They patiently endured the hardship of life and bore difficulties, yearning for the honor that is with Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic.\nThey sacrificed themselves seeking Allah's (swt) pleasure, and the conclusion of their deeds was martyrdom. Thus, they met Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, while He (swt) was pleased with them.\nThey (these people) have understood that death is the path for those who have passed and those who remain.\nTherefore, they prepared for their Hereafter, not with gold or silver, but by wearing coarse garments, patiently enduring trials, prioritizing virtue, loving for the sake of Allah (swt), and hating for the sake of Allah (swt), the Mighty and Majestic. They are the beacons of light and the people of bliss in the Hereafter. And peace be upon you.\"\nThe elderly man said: \"Where could I go, leaving Paradise behind when I can see it and see its people with you, O' Commander of the Faithful (as)? Equip me with strength so that I may fight your enemies.\"\nSo the Commander of the Faithful (as), peace be upon him, provided him with weapons and provisions. The elderly man joined the battle, fighting in front of Commander of the Faithful (as), peace be upon him, striking (fighting) with great vigor.\nThe Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, was amazed at what the elderly man did. When the battle intensified, the elderly man charged his horse forwards until he was martyred - may Allah (swt) have mercy on him.\nOne of the companions of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, followed him and found him lying lifeless, his mount nearby, and his sword still in his hand. When the battle ended, the companion brought his mount and weapons to the Commander of the Faithful.\nThe Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, prayed over him and said:\n\"This (elderly) man, by Allah (swt), is truly fortunate. So seek mercy for your brother.\"",

If you do not go to it, it will come to you. So do not burden yourself with the worries of your entire year upon the concern of your day; each day is sufficient with what it holds.\nIf the year is part of your life, then Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, will bring to you each day what He (swt) has apportioned for you.\nAnd if the year is not part of your life, then why concern yourself with grief and anxiety over what is not yours?\nKnow that no seeker can overtake you in your sustenance, nor can anyone overpower you in it, and what has been decreed for you will not be kept from you. How many seekers have you seen exhausting themselves, yet their provision remains restricted, while others who seek with moderation find that destiny aids them? And everything is accompanied by its end.\nToday is yours, but you have no certainty of reaching tomorrow. How many have awaited a day they never lived to see? How many were envied at the beginning of a night, yet by its end, they were mourned? So do not be deceived by the prolonged presence of blessings from Allah (swt) or by the delay in the arrival of punishment, for if He (swt) feared missing the opportunity, He (swt) would hasten the punishment before death.\nO' my son, accept the wisdom of the wise, reflect upon their judgments, and be the one who adheres most to what you command others and refrains most from what you forbid.\nEnjoin what is good so that you may be among its people, for the completion of matters lies with Allah (swt), Blessed and Exalted.\"\nEnjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and seek understanding in religion, for the jurists are the inheritors of the prophets. The prophets did not leave behind dinars or dirhams, but rather, they left behind knowledge, and whoever takes from it has taken a great share.\nKnow that the seeker of knowledge is prayed for by those in the heavens and the earth, even the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea. The angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of pleasure for him. In knowledge, there is the honor of this world and success in Paradise on the Day of Judgment, for the jurists are the callers to Paradise and the guides to Allah (swt), Blessed and Exalted.\nTreat all people kindly just as you would like to be treated, and be pleased for them with what you are pleased with for yourself.\nDislike for yourself what you dislike in others, and perfect your character with all people so that if you are absent, they long for you, and if you die, they weep for you and say, 'Indeed, we belong to Allah (swt), and indeed, to Him we shall return.'\"\nAnd do not be among those about whom it is said at their death: 'All praise is due to Allah (swt), the Lord of the worlds.' (being grateful of your demise)\nKnow that the essence of intellect, after faith in Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, is managing relationships with people. There is no good in one who does not deal kindly with those whom he must interact with, until Allah (swt) provides a way for deliverance from them. Indeed, I have found that everything by which people live and associate with one another fills a measure - two-thirds of it is appreciation, and one-third of it is overlooking faults.\nAllah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, has created nothing better than speech, and nothing more disgraceful than it. With speech, faces are brightened, and with speech, faces are blackened.\nKnow that speech remains under your control as long as you have not spoken it, but once you have spoken it, you become under its control. So guard your tongue as you would guard your gold and silver, for the tongue is a vicious dog - if you release it, it will bite. Many a word has stripped a person of blessings.\nWhoever lets go of his restraint is led to every undesirable and disgraceful act, and he will not be saved from his time except with the wrath of Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic and blame from people will follow the one who risks himself by relying solely on his own opinion.\nWhoever considers multiple perspectives will recognize where mistakes lie.\nWhoever rushes into matters without looking at the consequences exposes himself to devastating calamities.\nPlanning before action protects you from regret.\nThe intelligent one is he who learns from experiences, for in experiences lies new knowledge, and in the changes of circumstances lies the knowledge of the true nature of men.\nThe passing of days reveals hidden secrets.\nUnderstand this will of mine, and do not disregard it, for the best speech is that which benefits. Know, O' my son, that you must carefully seek provision and take only what is necessary while keeping your burden light. Do not load upon your back more than you can bear, lest it becomes a heavy burden upon you in your resurrection on the Day of Judgment.\nThe worst provision for the Hereafter is oppression against the servants of Allah (swt).\nKnow that ahead of you are dangers, pitfalls, bridges, and a steep ascent, which you will inevitably descend. Its descent will either lead to Paradise or to Hell. So prepare yourself before you reach it. If you find among those in need someone who can carry your provision to the Hereafter, so that he may deliver it to you when you are in dire need of it, then take advantage of this opportunity, and let him carry it for you while you have the ability. Perhaps a time will come when you seek such an opportunity but will not find it.\nBeware of entrusting your provisions to one who lacks piety and honesty, lest your condition be like that of a thirsty person who sees a mirage, but when he reaches it, he finds nothing, and so he remains stranded in the Hereafter with nothing to sustain him.\"\nAnd Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said in this will:\n\"O' my son, oppression leads to ruin.\nNo one will perish who knows his own worth.\nWhoever safeguards his desires preserves his dignity.\nThe worth of every person is in what they excel at.\nReflection brings guidance.\nThe noblest wealth is to abandon false hopes.\nGreed is present poverty.\nAffection is an acquired kinship.\nYour true friend is your brother from your father and mother, but not every sibling from your parents is your friend.\nDo not take the enemy of your friend as a friend, lest you become an enemy to your own friend.\nHow many distant people are closer to you than those who are near?\nA generous yet poor person is better than a wealthy but rude one.\nAdmonition is a refuge for those who heed it.\nWhoever boasts of his favor (to others) spoils it (their reward).\nWhoever has bad manners torments himself, and resentment is more fitting for him.\nIt is unjust to judge based on suspicion when trust is required.\nHow ugly is arrogance in victory, despair in hardship, cruelty to a neighbor, betrayal of a companion, breaking an oath by a noble person, and treachery from a ruler.\nDenying blessings leads to destruction, and keeping company with a fool is misfortune.\nAcknowledge the right of those who uphold it, whether they are noble or lowly.\nWhoever abandons moderation goes astray.\nWhoever oversteps justice finds his path narrow. How many ailing people have survived, and how many healthy ones have perished? Sometimes despair leads to success, and greed leads to destruction.\nReconcile with those whom you hope will accept your apology.\nNever sleep with betrayal in your heart toward anyone, for betrayal is the worst trait of a Muslim.\nWhoever betrays is likely to never be trusted again.\nCorruption ruins abundance, while moderation increases little.\nOf nobility is fulfilling covenants.\nWhoever is generous will lead, and whoever seeks understanding will increase in wisdom.\nBe sincere in advising your brother and support him in all matters, as long as he does not lead you into disobedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic.\"\nStay with your brother wherever he goes. Do not sever ties with him over doubt, nor cut him off without first seeking reconciliation - perhaps he has an excuse while you blame him.\nAccept the apology of one who seeks pardon, so that intercession may reach you.\nHonor those through whom you gain strength, and lengthen your companionship with them in kindness, respect, reverence, and esteem.\nThe recompense of one who elevates your status is not that you lower his, and the reward of one who brings you joy is not that you cause him sorrow.\nShow as much kindness as you can to your companion, for when you wish, you will find his guidance.\nThe faults of one clothed in modesty remain hidden from sight.\nWhoever maintains moderation finds his burdens lightened. Whoever does not grant his soul its desires attains wisdom.\nWith every hardship, there is ease, and with every meal, there may be choking. No blessing is attained except after hardship.\nBe gentle with one who angers you, and you will achieve your goal.\nThe hours of distress are hours of atonement, and time gradually consumes your life.\nThere is no good in a pleasure that is followed by the Fire. And no good is truly good if it is followed by the Fire, and no evil is truly evil if it is followed by Paradise.\nEvery pleasure besides Paradise is insignificant, and every hardship besides the Fire is a form of well-being.\nDo not neglect your brother's right, relying on the bond between you and him, for he is not truly your brother if you disregard his right.\nDo not let your brother be stronger in cutting ties with you than you are in maintaining them, nor let him be more capable of harming you than you are of showing kindness to him.\nO' my son, when you are strong, then be strong in obedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, and when you are weak, then let your weakness be in avoiding disobedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic.\nIf you can, do not grant a woman authority over her affairs beyond herself, for that preserves her beauty longer, brings her more peace of mind, and improves her condition.\nA woman is like a delicate flower, not a steward - so treat her kindly in every situation, and be good in your companionship with her so that your life may be peaceful.\nAccept fate with contentment.\nIf you wish to gather the best of this world and the Hereafter, then cut your expectations from what is in the hands of people.\nAnd peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah (swt), and His (swt) blessings.\"",

		"thaqalaynMatn": "\"O' my son, beware of relying on vain hopes, for they are the merchandise of the foolish and a hindrance from the Hereafter.\nOne of the best fortunes a person can have is a righteous companion - sit with the people of goodness, and you will be one of them; separate yourself from the people of evil.\nKeep away from those who divert you from the remembrance of Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, and the remembrance of death with embellished falsehoods and fabricated rumors.\nDo not let ill thoughts about Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, overpower you, for they will not leave any reconciliation between you and your friend.\nDiscipline your heart with good manners as fire is kindled with wood, for good manners are a great aid for one's nature, and experiences are a guide for the wise.\nCombine the opinions of different men, then choose the one closest to correctness and farthest from doubt.\nO' my son, there is no honor higher than Islam,\nno dignity greater than piety, n\no stronghold more secure than restraint,\nno intercessor more effective than repentance,\nno garment more beautiful than well-being,\nno protection stronger than safety,\nand no treasure wealthier than contentment.\nAnd there is no wealth that removes poverty better than contentment with sustenance.\nWhoever suffices with the bare necessities has attained ease and settled in comfort.\nGreed leads to plunging into sins.\nCast away intrusive worries with firm resolve in patience.\nAccustom yourself to patience, for it is the best of manners, and endure the hardships and concerns of this world.\nThe successful ones have triumphed, and those for whom Allah (swt) has decreed goodness have been saved, for patience is a shield against poverty.\nEntrust all your affairs to Allah (swt), the One (swt), the All-Dominant (swt), for in doing so, you take refuge in a fortified cave, a secure stronghold, and an invincible protector.\nSincerely direct your supplications to your Lord (swt), for in His (swt) hands are all good and evil, giving and withholding, granting and depriving.\"\nAnd Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as), said in this will:\n\"O' my son, sustenance is of two kinds: one that you seek, and one that seeks you. If you do not go to it, it will come to you. So do not burden yourself with the worries of your entire year upon the concern of your day; each day is sufficient with what it holds.\nIf the year is part of your life, then Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, will bring to you each day what He (swt) has apportioned for you.\nAnd if the year is not part of your life, then why concern yourself with grief and anxiety over what is not yours?\nKnow that no seeker can overtake you in your sustenance, nor can anyone overpower you in it, and what has been decreed for you will not be kept from you. How many seekers have you seen exhausting themselves, yet their provision remains restricted, while others who seek with moderation find that destiny aids them? And everything is accompanied by its end.\nToday is yours, but you have no certainty of reaching tomorrow. How many have awaited a day they never lived to see? How many were envied at the beginning of a night, yet by its end, they were mourned? So do not be deceived by the prolonged presence of blessings from Allah (swt) or by the delay in the arrival of punishment, for if He (swt) feared missing the opportunity, He (swt) would hasten the punishment before death.\nO' my son, accept the wisdom of the wise, reflect upon their judgments, and be the one who adheres most to what you command others and refrains most from what you forbid.\nEnjoin what is good so that you may be among its people, for the completion of matters lies with Allah (swt), Blessed and Exalted.\"\nEnjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and seek understanding in religion, for the jurists are the inheritors of the prophets. The prophets did not leave behind dinars or dirhams, but rather, they left behind knowledge, and whoever takes from it has taken a great share.\nKnow that the seeker of knowledge is prayed for by those in the heavens and the earth, even the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea. The angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of pleasure for him. In knowledge, there is the honor of this world and success in Paradise on the Day of Judgment, for the jurists are the callers to Paradise and the guides to Allah (swt), Blessed and Exalted.\nTreat all people kindly just as you would like to be treated, and be pleased for them with what you are pleased with for yourself.\nDislike for yourself what you dislike in others, and perfect your character with all people so that if you are absent, they long for you, and if you die, they weep for you and say, 'Indeed, we belong to Allah (swt), and indeed, to Him we shall return.'\"\nAnd do not be among those about whom it is said at their death: 'All praise is due to Allah (swt), the Lord of the worlds.' (being grateful of your demise)\nKnow that the essence of intellect, after faith in Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, is managing relationships with people. There is no good in one who does not deal kindly with those whom he must interact with, until Allah (swt) provides a way for deliverance from them. Indeed, I have found that everything by which people live and associate with one another fills a measure - two-thirds of it is appreciation, and one-third of it is overlooking faults.\nAllah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, has created nothing better than speech, and nothing more disgraceful than it. With speech, faces are brightened, and with speech, faces are blackened.\nKnow that speech remains under your control as long as you have not spoken it, but once you have spoken it, you become under its control. So guard your tongue as you would guard your gold and silver, for the tongue is a vicious dog - if you release it, it will bite. Many a word has stripped a person of blessings.\nWhoever lets go of his restraint is led to every undesirable and disgraceful act, and he will not be saved from his time except with the wrath of Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic and blame from people will follow the one who risks himself by relying solely on his own opinion.\nWhoever considers multiple perspectives will recognize where mistakes lie.\nWhoever rushes into matters without looking at the consequences exposes himself to devastating calamities.\nPlanning before action protects you from regret.\nThe intelligent one is he who learns from experiences, for in experiences lies new knowledge, and in the changes of circumstances lies the knowledge of the true nature of men.\nThe passing of days reveals hidden secrets.\nUnderstand this will of mine, and do not disregard it, for the best speech is that which benefits. Know, O' my son, that you must carefully seek provision and take only what is necessary while keeping your burden light. Do not load upon your back more than you can bear, lest it becomes a heavy burden upon you in your resurrection on the Day of Judgment.\nThe worst provision for the Hereafter is oppression against the servants of Allah (swt).\nKnow that ahead of you are dangers, pitfalls, bridges, and a steep ascent, which you will inevitably descend. Its descent will either lead to Paradise or to Hell. So prepare yourself before you reach it. If you find among those in need someone who can carry your provision to the Hereafter, so that he may deliver it to you when you are in dire need of it, then take advantage of this opportunity, and let him carry it for you while you have the ability. Perhaps a time will come when you seek such an opportunity but will not find it.\nBeware of entrusting your provisions to one who lacks piety and honesty, lest your condition be like that of a thirsty person who sees a mirage, but when he reaches it, he finds nothing, and so he remains stranded in the Hereafter with nothing to sustain him.\"\nAnd Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as) said in this will:\n\"O' my son, oppression leads to ruin.\nNo one will perish who knows his own worth.\nWhoever safeguards his desires preserves his dignity.\nThe worth of every person is in what they excel at.\nReflection brings guidance.\nThe noblest wealth is to abandon false hopes.\nGreed is present poverty.\nAffection is an acquired kinship.\nYour true friend is your brother from your father and mother, but not every sibling from your parents is your friend.\nDo not take the enemy of your friend as a friend, lest you become an enemy to your own friend.\nHow many distant people are closer to you than those who are near?\nA generous yet poor person is better than a wealthy but rude one.\nAdmonition is a refuge for those who heed it.\nWhoever boasts of his favor (to others) spoils it (their reward).\nWhoever has bad manners torments himself, and resentment is more fitting for him.\nIt is unjust to judge based on suspicion when trust is required.\nHow ugly is arrogance in victory, despair in hardship, cruelty to a neighbor, betrayal of a companion, breaking an oath by a noble person, and treachery from a ruler.\nDenying blessings leads to destruction, and keeping company with a fool is misfortune.\nAcknowledge the right of those who uphold it, whether they are noble or lowly.\nWhoever abandons moderation goes astray.\nWhoever oversteps justice finds his path narrow. How many ailing people have survived, and how many healthy ones have perished? Sometimes despair leads to success, and greed leads to destruction.\nReconcile with those whom you hope will accept your apology.\nNever sleep with betrayal in your heart toward anyone, for betrayal is the worst trait of a Muslim.\nWhoever betrays is likely to never be trusted again.\nCorruption ruins abundance, while moderation increases little.\nOf nobility is fulfilling covenants.\nWhoever is generous will lead, and whoever seeks understanding will increase in wisdom.\nBe sincere in advising your brother and support him in all matters, as long as he does not lead you into disobedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic.\"\nStay with your brother wherever he goes. Do not sever ties with him over doubt, nor cut him off without first seeking reconciliation - perhaps he has an excuse while you blame him.\nAccept the apology of one who seeks pardon, so that intercession may reach you.\nHonor those through whom you gain strength, and lengthen your companionship with them in kindness, respect, reverence, and esteem.\nThe recompense of one who elevates your status is not that you lower his, and the reward of one who brings you joy is not that you cause him sorrow.\nShow as much kindness as you can to your companion, for when you wish, you will find his guidance.\nThe faults of one clothed in modesty remain hidden from sight.\nWhoever maintains moderation finds his burdens lightened. Whoever does not grant his soul its desires attains wisdom.\nWith every hardship, there is ease, and with every meal, there may be choking. No blessing is attained except after hardship.\nBe gentle with one who angers you, and you will achieve your goal.\nThe hours of distress are hours of atonement, and time gradually consumes your life.\nThere is no good in a pleasure that is followed by the Fire. And no good is truly good if it is followed by the Fire, and no evil is truly evil if it is followed by Paradise.\nEvery pleasure besides Paradise is insignificant, and every hardship besides the Fire is a form of well-being.\nDo not neglect your brother's right, relying on the bond between you and him, for he is not truly your brother if you disregard his right.\nDo not let your brother be stronger in cutting ties with you than you are in maintaining them, nor let him be more capable of harming you than you are of showing kindness to him.\nO' my son, when you are strong, then be strong in obedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic, and when you are weak, then let your weakness be in avoiding disobedience to Allah (swt), Mighty and Majestic.\nIf you can, do not grant a woman authority over her affairs beyond herself, for that preserves her beauty longer, brings her more peace of mind, and improves her condition.\nA woman is like a delicate flower, not a steward - so treat her kindly in every situation, and be good in your companionship with her so that your life may be peaceful.\nAccept fate with contentment.\nIf you wish to gather the best of this world and the Hereafter, then cut your expectations from what is in the hands of people.\nAnd peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah (swt), and His (swt) blessings.\"",

Allah (swt) places their lights in pure loins and immaculate wombs, protecting them with His (swt) angels, nurturing them with His (swt) wisdom, and sustaining them with His (swt) knowledge.\nTheir matter is too great to be described, and their conditions are too subtle to be comprehended, for they are the stars of Allah (swt) on His (swt) earth, His (swt) signs among His (swt) creation, His (swt) successors over His (swt) servants (people), His (swt) lights in His (swt) lands, and His (swt) proofs over His (swt) creation.\nO' Jabir, this is part of the concealed and stored knowledge, so conceal it except from those who are worthy of it.\"",
